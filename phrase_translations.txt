good luck, fair winds
Get out of my way,gangway
a shot,clap  o' thunder
best friend,best bucko
on it,aye aye
old man,old salt
kill him,blow the man down
pardon me,avast
excuse me,arrr
where is,whar be
can you help me find, know ye
is that, be that
how far is it to, how many leagues t'
I would like, I be needin'
I whish I knew how to, I be hankerin to
my mother told me, me dear ol mum, bless her black soul, tol me to
take a nap, have a bit of a lie down
have a drink, swill a pint or two of grog
