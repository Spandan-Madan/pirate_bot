Drink up, me hearties, yo ho We kidnap and ravage and don't give a hoot Drink up, me hearties, yo ho Yo ho, yo ho A pirate's life for me We extort, we pilfer We filch, we sack... Quiet, missy!
Cursed pirates sail these waters.
You don't want to bring them down on us.
Mr. Gibbs, that will do.
She was singing about pirates!
Bad luck to sing about pirates with us mired in this unnatural fog.
Mark my words.
Consider them marked.
On your way.
Aye, Lieutenant.
Bad luck to have a woman on board, too.
Even a miniature one.
It'd be exciting to meet a pirate.
Think again, Miss Swann.
Vile creatures, the lot of them.
I intend to see to it that any man who sails under a pirate flag gets what he deserves.
A short drop and a sudden stop.
I appreciate your fervor, but I'm concerned about the effect this subject will have upon my daughter.
My apologies, Governor Swann.
Actually, I find it all fascinating.
That's what concerns me.
There's a boy in the water!
Man overboard!
Man the ropes!
Fetch a hook!
Haul him aboard!
He's still breathing.
Mary, Mother of God!
What happened here?
Most likely the powder magazine.
Merchant vessels run heavily armed.
Lot of good it did them.
Everyone's thinking it, I'm saying it.
Pirates!
There's no proof of that!
It was probably an accident.
Rouse the captain.
Heave to and take in sail.
Launch the boats.
Elizabeth, accompany the boy.
He'll be in your charge.
Take care of him.
He'll be in your charge.
Take care of him.
It's okay.
My name's Elizabeth Swann.
Will Turner.
I'm watching over you, Will.
You're a pirate!
Has he said anything?
His name's William Turner.
That's all I found out.
Take him below.
Elizabeth!
Are you all right?
Are you decent?
Yes.
Yes?
Still abed at this hour?
It's a beautiful day.
I have a gift for you.
It's beautiful!
Isn't it?
May I inquire as to the occasion?
Does a father need an occasion to dote upon his daughter?
Go on.
Actually...
I had hoped you might wear it for the ceremony today.
The ceremony?
Captain Norrington's promotion ceremony.
I knew it!
Commodore Norrington, as he's about to become.
A fine gentleman, don't you think?
He fancies you, you know.
Elizabeth?
How's it coming?
It's difficult to say.
It's the latest fashion in London.
Women in London must've learned not to breathe!
My Lord, you have a visitor.
Mr. Turner!
Good to see you again.
Good day, sir.
I have your order.
The blade is folded steel.
That's gold filigree laid into the handle.
If I may?
Perfectly balanced.
The tang is nearly the width of the blade.
Perfectly balanced.
The tang is nearly the width of the blade.
Impressive.
Very impressive.
Commodore Norrington's going to be very pleased with this.
Do pass my compliments onto your master.
I shall.
A craftsman is always pleased to hear his work is appreciated.
Elizabeth!
You look absolutely stunning!
Will!
It's so good to see you!
I had a dream about you last night.
About me?
Elizabeth, is that proper?
About the day we met.
Remember?
How could I forget, Miss Swann?
How many times must I ask you to call me Elizabeth?
At least once more, Miss Swann.
As always.
There.
See?
At least the boy has a sense of propriety.
We really must be going.
Good day, Mr. Turner.
Come along!
Good day... Elizabeth.
Hold up there, you!
It's a shilling to tie up your boat to the dock.
I need to know your name.
What do you say to three shillings and we forget the name?
Welcome to Port Royal, Mr. Smith.
Two paces... march!
Right about... face!
Present... arms!
This dock is off limits to civilians.
This dock is off limits to civilians.
I'm terribly sorry, I didn't know.
If I see one, I shall inform you.
I'm terribly sorry, I didn't know.
If I see one, I shall inform you.
There's some high-toned and fancy to-do at the fort.
How could it be that two upstanding gentlemen did not merit an invitation?
We have to make sure this dock stays off limits to civilians.
It's a fine goal, to be sure, but it seems to me, a ship like that makes this one here a bit superfluous.
The Dauntless is the power in these waters, but there's no ship that can match the Interceptor for speed.
I've heard of one.
It's supposed to be fast, nigh uncatchable.
The Black Pearl.
There's no real ship that can match the Interceptor.
The Black Pearl is a real ship.
No, it's not.
It is.
I've seen it!
You've seen it?
Yes.
You haven't seen it!
Yes, I have!
You've seen a ship with black sails, that's crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that Hell itself spat him back out?
No.
No.
But I have seen a ship with black sails.
No ship not crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil, Hell spat him back out, could have black sails, so couldn't be any other ship than The Black Pearl.
Is that what you're saying?
No.
Like I said, there's no real ship that can match the Interceptor... You!
Get away from there!
You don't have permission to be aboard!
I'm sorry, but it's such a pretty boat.
Ship!
What's your name?
Smith!
Or Smithy, if you like.
What's your purpose in Port Royal, 'Mr.
Smith'?
And no lies!
All right.
I confess.
I intend to commandeer a ship, pick up a crew in Tortuga, I intend to commandeer a ship, pick up a crew in Tortuga, rape, pillage and otherwise pilfer my black guts out.
I said no lies!
I think he's telling the truth.
If he were telling the truth, he wouldn't have told us.
Unless he knew you wouldn't believe the truth even if he told you.
May I have a moment?
You look lovely, Elizabeth.
I apologize if I seem forward, but I must speak my mind.
This promotion throws into sharp relief that which I have not yet achieved.
A marriage to a fine woman.
You have become a fine woman.
I can't breathe!
Yes, I'm a bit nervous myself.
Then they made me their chief.
Elizabeth?
Elizabeth!
The rocks!
Sir, it's a miracle she missed them!
Will you be saving her?
I can't swim!
Pride of the King's Navy, you are!
Do not lose these.
What was that?
I got her!
She's not breathing!
Move!
I never would've thought of that.
You've never been to Singapore.
Where did you get that?
On your feet.
Elizabeth!
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
Shoot him!
Father!
Commodore, do you intend to kill my rescuer?
I believe thanks are in order.
Had a brush with the East India Trading Company, pirate?
Hang him!
Keep your guns on him, men.
Gillette, fetch some irons.
Well, well.
Jack Sparrow, isn't it?
Captain Jack Sparrow, if you please, sir.
I don't see your ship... 'Captain'.
I'm in the market, as it were.
He said he'd come to commandeer one.
I told you he was telling the truth.
These are his.
No additional shot nor powder.
A compass that doesn't point north.
I half expected it to be made from wood.
You are without doubt the worst pirate I've ever heard of!
But you have heard of me.
Commodore, I must protest!
Carefully, Lieutenant.
Pirate or not, this man saved my life!
One good deed is not enough to redeem a man for his wickedness!
It seems enough to condemn him.
Indeed.
Finally.
Don't shoot!
I knew you'd warm up to me.
Commodore Norrington, my effects, please.
And my hat.
Commodore.
Elizabeth... it is Elizabeth?
It's Miss Swann.
Miss Swann, if you'd be so kind.
Come, dear, we don't have all day.
If you'll be very kind.
Easy on the goods, darling.
You're despicable.
Sticks and stones, love.
I saved your life, you saved mine.
We're square.
Gentlemen, my lady, you will always remember this as the day you almost caught... Captain Jack Sparrow!
Now will you shoot him?
Open fire!
On his heels!
Take cover, man!
Gillette, Mr. Sparrow has a dawn appointment with the gallows.
I would hate for him to miss it.
Search up the stairs!
Look lively, men!
Right where I left you.
Not where I left you.
You're the one they're hunting.
The pirate!
You seem familiar.
Have I threatened you before?
I avoid familiarity with pirates.
It would be a shame to put a black mark on your record.
Excuse me.
Do you think this wise, boy?
Crossing blades with a pirate?
You threatened Miss Swann.
Only a little.
You know what you're doing.
Excellent form.
How's your footwork?
If I step here... Good.
And now I step again.
Ta.
That is a wonderful trick.
Except, once again, you are between me and my way out.
And now... you have no weapon.
Who makes all these?
I do.
And I practice with them three hours a day.
You need to find yourself a girl, mate.
Or, the reason you practice three hours a day is that you already found one and are otherwise incapable of wooing said strumpet.
You're not a eunuch, are you?
I practice three hours a day so when I meet a pirate, I can kill him!
You cheated!
Pirate.
Move away!
No.
Please?
No!
I cannot just step aside and let you escape.
This shot is not meant for you.
There he is!
Over here!
Excellent work, Mr. Brown.
You've assisted in the capture of a fugitive.
Just doing my civic duty, sir.
I trust you will remember this as the day Captain Jack Sparrow almost escaped.
Take him away.
Come here, boy.
Come here.
Who wants a juicy bone?
Come here, boy!
You can keep doing that forever.
The dog is never going to move.
Excuse us if we haven't resigned ourselves to the gallows just yet.
There you go, miss.
It was a difficult day for you, I'm sure.
I suspected Commodore Norrington would propose, but I wasn't prepared for it.
I meant you being threatened by that pirate!
Sounds terrifying!
Yes, it was terrifying.
But... the Commodore proposed!
Fancy that.
That's a smart match, miss, if it's not too bold to say.
It is a smart match.
He's a fine man.
He's what any woman should dream of marrying.
That Will Turner... he's a fine man, too.
That is too bold.
Beggin' your pardon.
It was not my place.
Has my daughter given you an answer yet?
No, she hasn't.
She has had a trying day.
Ghastly weather, don't you think?
Really bleak.
What's that?
Cannon fire!
Return fire!
I know those guns.
It's the Pearl.
The Black Pearl?
I've heard stories.
She's been preying on ships and settlements for ten years.
Never leaves any survivors.
No survivors?
Then where do the stories come from, I wonder?
Mama!
Sight the muzzle flash.
Aim for the flashes!
I need a full spread, fore and aft.
Mr. Stevens, more cartridges.
Governor.
Barricade yourself in my office.
That's an order.
Don't!
Hello, chum.
Up there!
Miss Swann, they've come to kidnap you.
What?
You're the governor's daughter!
In here!
They haven't seen you.
First chance you get, run to the fort.
Gotcha!
No!
It's hot.
I'm burning!
Come on!
Come on, me men.
We know you're here, poppet.
Poppet!
Come out.
We promise we won't hurt you.
We will find you, poppet.
You've got something of ours and it calls to us.
The gold calls to us.
The gold.
Hello, poppet.
Parley.
What?
I invoke the right of parley.
The Code of the Brethren states you have to take me to your captain.
I know the Code.
You can do me no harm until the parley is complete.
To blazes with the Code.
She wants to be taken to the Captain.
And she'll go, without a fuss.
We must honor the Code.
Say goodbye!
Goodbye.
Come on.
Elizabeth.
Out of my way, scum!
My sympathies.
You've no manner of luck at all.
Come on, doggy!
It's just you and me now.
It's you and old Jack.
Come on.
That's a boy!
Get your bone!
That's a good boy.
A bit closer!
That's it, doggy!
Come on, you filthy, slimy, mangy character!
No!
I didn't mean it!
This ain't the armory!
Well, well, well.
Look what we have here, Twigg.
Captain Jack Sparrow!
Last time I saw you, you were all alone on a godforsaken island, shrinking into the distance.
His fortunes aren't improved much.
Worry about your own fortunes, gentlemen.
The deepest circle of Hell is reserved for betrayers and mutineers.
So there is a curse.
That's interesting.
You know nothing of Hell.
That's very interesting.
I didn't know we was takin' on captives.
She's invoked the right of parley with Captain Barbossa.
I am here to... You will speak when spoken to.
And ye will not lay a hand on those under the protection of parley.
Aye, sir.
My apologies, miss.
Captain Barbossa...
I am here to negotiate the cessation of hostilities.
There are a lot of long words there.
We're naught but humble pirates.
What is it you want?
Leave and never come back.
I'm disinclined to acquiesce to your request.
Means "no."
Very well.
I'll drop it.
Me holds are burstin' with swag.
That bit of shine matters to us?
Why?
It's what you've been searching for.
I recognize the ship.
I saw it eight years ago on the crossing from England!
Did you now?
Fine.
I suppose if it is worthless there's no point in me keeping it.
No!
You have a name, missy?
Elizabeth... Turner.
I'm a maid in the Governor's household.
Miss Turner!
Turner!
Bootstrap!
How does a maid come to own that trinket?
Family heirloom?
I didn't steal it, if that's what you mean.
You hand it over and we'll leave and never return.
Our bargain?
Still the guns and stow them.
Signal the men and make good to clear port.
You have to take me to shore.
According to the Code... First...
Your return to shore was not part of our negotiations so I must do nothing.
Secondly, you must be a pirate for the Pirate's Code to apply, and you're not.
Thirdly, the code is more what you'd call guidelines than actual rules.
Welcome aboard the Black Pearl, Miss Turner.
They've taken Elizabeth!
Mr. Murtogg, remove this man.
We have to hunt them down.
We must save her.
Where do you propose we start?
If you have any information concerning my daughter, share it.
That Jack Sparrow.
He talked about the Black Pearl.
Mentioned it is more what he did.
Ask him where it is!
He could lead us to it.
No.
The pirates left Sparrow in his cell, ergo they are not his allies.
We will establish their most likely course... That's not good enough!
Mr. Turner, you are not a military man or a sailor.
You are a blacksmith.
And this is not the moment for rash actions!
Do not think you are the only man here who cares for Elizabeth.
Please.
You!
Sparrow!
Aye?
You are familiar with the Black Pearl?
I've heard of it.
Where does it make berth?
Where does it make berth?
Have you not heard the stories?
Captain Barbossa and his crew of miscreants sail from the Isla de Muerta.
It's an island that cannot be found, except by those who know where it is.
The ship's real, therefore its anchorage must be a real place.
Where?
Why ask me?
Because you're a pirate.
You want to turn pirate yourself.
Is that it?
Never!
They took Miss Swann.
So it is that you found a girl!
I see!
If you intend to brave all, hasten to her rescue, and so, win fair lady's heart, you'll have to do it alone, mate.
I see no profit in it for me.
I can get you out of here.
The key's run off.
I helped build these cells.
These are half-pin barrel hinges.
With leverage and the proper application of strength, the door will lift free.
What's your name?
Will Turner.
That would be short for William, I imagine.
Good, strong name.
No doubt named for your father.
Yes.
Mr. Turner, I've changed me mind.
If you spring me from here, I swear, on pain of death, I shall take you to the Black Pearl, and your bonny lass.
Do we have an accord?
Agreed.
Agreed!
Get me out!
Hurry!
Someone will have heard that.
Not without my effects.
We're going to steal a ship?
That ship?
Commandeer.
We're going to "commandeer" that ship.
Nautical term.
One question about your business, or there's no use going.
This girl, how far are you willing to go to save her?
I'd die for her.
Good.
No worries then.
This is either madness or brilliance.
It's remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
Everyone stay calm!
We're taking over the ship.
Aye!
Avast!
This ship cannot be crewed by two men.
You'll never make it out of the bay.
Son...
I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.
Savvy?
Commodore!
They're taking the Dauntless!
Commodore!
They've taken the ship!
Sparrow and Turner!
They're taking the Dauntless!
Rash, Turner.
Too rash.
That is, without doubt, the worst pirate I have ever seen.
Here they come.
Bring her around!
Search every cabin, every hold, down to the bilges.
Sailors, back to the Interceptor!
Thank you, Commodore, for getting us ready to make way.
We'd have had a hard time by ourselves.
Set topsails and clear up this mess.
With this wind we won't catch them.
I don't need to.
Get them in range of the long nines.
Run out the guns!
We are to fire on our own ship, sir?
I'd rather see her at the bottom of the ocean than in the hands of a pirate.
Commodore!
He's disabled the rudder chain.
Abandon ship!
That's got to be the best pirate I've ever seen.
So it would seem.
When I was a lad living in England, my mother raised me by herself.
After she died, I came here, looking for my father.
Is that so?
My father, Bill Turner?
It was only after you learned my name you agreed to help.
Since that's what I wanted, I didn't press the matter.
I'm not a simpleton.
You knew my father.
I knew him.
Probably one of the few who knew him as William Turner.
Everyone else just called him "Bootstrap".
Bootstrap?
Good man.
Good pirate.
I swear, you look just like him.
It's not true.
He was a merchant sailor.
A respectable man who obeyed the law.
He was a bloody pirate, a scallywag.
My father was not a pirate!
Put it away, son.
It's not worth you getting beat again.
You ignored the rules of engagement.
In a fair fight, I'd kill you.
That's not much incentive for me to fight fair, is it?
As long as you're just hanging there, pay attention.
The only rules that matter are these: What a man can do and what a man can't do.
You can accept your father was a pirate and a good man, or you can't.
Pirate is in your blood, so you'll have to square with that someday.
Me, for example, I can let you drown, but I can't bring this ship into Tortuga all by me onesies, savvy?
So.
Can you sail under the command of a pirate?
Or can you not?
Tortuga?
Tortuga.
It is a sad life that has never breathed deep the sweet, proliferous bouquet that is Tortuga.
Savvy?
What do you think?
It'll linger.
I'll tell you, mate, if every town were like this one, no man would ever feel unwanted.
Scarlett!
Not sure I deserved that.
Not sure I deserved that.
Giselle.
Giselle.
Who was she?
What?
I may have deserved that.
Curse you for breathing, you slack-jawed idiot!
Mother's love!
Jack!
You should know not to wake a man when he's sleepin'.
It's bad luck.
Fortunately, I know how to counter it.
The man who did the waking buys the man who was sleeping a drink.
The man who was sleeping drinks it while listening to his proposition.
Aye, that'll about do it.
Blast!
I'm already awake!
That was for the smell.
Keep a sharp eye.
Now, what's the nature of this venture of your'n?
Now, what's the nature of this venture of your'n?
I'm going after the Black Pearl.
I know where it's going to be, and I'm gonna take it.
Jack, it's a fool's errand.
You know better than me the tales of the Black Pearl.
That's why I know what Barbossa is up to.
All I need is a crew.
Captain Barbossa is not a man to suffer fools nor strike a bargain with one.
It's a good thing I'm not a fool, then.
Prove me wrong.
What makes you think Barbossa will give up his ship to you?
Let's just say it's a matter of leverage.
The kid?
That is the child of Bootstrap Bill Turner.
His only child.
Savvy?
Is he now?
Leverage, says you.
I feel a change in the wind, says I. I'll find us a crew.
There's bound to be some sailors on this rock crazy as you.
One can only hope.
Take what you can!
Give nothin' back!
Take what you can!
Give nothin' back!
You'll be dining with the captain, and he requests you wear this.
Tell him that I am disinclined to acquiesce to his request.
He said you'd say that.
He also said if that be the case, you'll be dining with the crew.
And you'll be naked.
Fine.
There's no need to stand on ceremony, no call to impress anyone.
You must be hungry.
Try the wine.
And the apples.
One of those next.
It's poisoned.
There would be no sense to be killing you.
Then release me.
You have your trinket.
I'm of no further value to you.
You don't know what this is, do you?
It's a pirate medallion.
This is Aztec gold.
One of 882 identical pieces they delivered in a stone chest to Corts.
Blood money paid to stem the slaughter he wreaked upon them with his armies.
Blood money paid to stem the slaughter he wreaked upon them with his armies.
But the greed of Corts was insatiable.
So the heathen gods placed upon the gold... a terrible curse.
Any mortal that removes but a single piece from that stone chest... shall be punished for eternity.
Shall be punished for eternity.
I hardly believe in ghost stories any more, Captain Barbossa.
Aye.
That's exactly what I thought when we were first told the tale.
Buried on an island of the dead what cannot be found, except for those who know where it is.
Find it, we did.
There be the chest.
Inside be the gold.
And we took 'em all!
We spent 'em and traded 'em, and frittered 'em away on drink and food and pleasurable company.
The more we gave 'em away, the more we came to realize... the drink would not satisfy.
Food turned to ash in our mouths, Food turned to ash in our mouths, and all the pleasurable company in the world could not slake our lust.
We are cursed men, Miss Turner.
Compelled by greed we were, but now... we are consumed by it.
There is one way we can end our curse.
All the scattered pieces of the Aztec gold must be restored, and the blood repaid.
Thanks to ye, we have the final piece.
And the blood to be repaid?
That's why there's no sense to be killing you.
Yet.
Apple?
I'm curious.
After killing me, what are you planning on doing next?
Look!
The moonlight shows us for what we really are.
We are not among the living and so we cannot die.
We are not among the living and so we cannot die.
But neither are we dead.
For too long I've been parched of thirst and unable to quench it.
Too long I've been starvin' to death and haven't died.
Too long I've been starvin' to death and haven't died.
I feel nothing.
Not the wind on my face, nor the spray of the sea... nor the warmth of a woman's flesh.
You best start believing in ghost stories, Miss Turner.
You're in one!
What are you looking at?
Back to work!
You heard the captain.
Back to work.
Feast your eyes, Captain.
All of them, faithful hands before the mast.
Every man worth his salt, and crazy to boot.
So this is your able-bodied crew?
You, sailor!
Cotton, sir.
Mr. Cotton, do you have the courage and fortitude to follow orders and stay true in the face of danger and almost certain death?
Mr. Cotton.
Answer, man!
He's a mute, sir.
Poor devil had his tongue cut out, so he trained the parrot to talk for him.
No one's yet figured how.
Mr. Cotton's parrot, same question.
Wind in your sails!
Wind in your sails!
Mostly, we figure that means "yes".
Of course it does.
Satisfied?
Well, you've proved they're mad.
What's the benefit for us?
Anamaria!
I suppose you didn't deserve that.
No, that one I deserved.
You stole my boat!
Actually... Borrowed without permission, but with every intention of bringing it back.
But you didn't!
You'll get another one.
I will.
A better one.
A better one!
That one.
What one?
That one?
Aye.
That one.
What say you?
Aye!
Aye!
Anchor's aweigh!
No, it's frightful bad luck to bring a woman aboard, sir.
It'll be far worse not to have her.
How can we sail to an island that nobody can find, with a compass that doesn't work?
The compass doesn't point north, but we're not trying to find north, are we?
We should drop canvas, sir.
She can hold a bit longer.
What's in your head as puts you in such a fine mood, Cap'n?
We're catching up.
Time to go, poppet.
Dead men tell no tales.
Chills the bones, how many honest sailors been claimed by this passage.
How is it that Jack came by that compass?
Not a lot's known about Jack Sparrow before he came to Tortuga with a mind to find the treasure of the Isla de Muerta.
That was before I'd met him, when he was captain of the Black Pearl.
What?
He failed to mention that.
He plays things close to the vest now.
And a hard-learned lesson it was.
Three days into the trip, the first mate says, "Everything's an equal share."
"The location of the treasure, too."
So Jack gives up the bearings.
That night, there was a mutiny.
They marooned Jack on an island and left him to die.
But not before he'd gone mad with the heat.
So that's the reason for all the... Reason's got nothing to do with it.
When a pirate's marooned, he's given a pistol with a single shot.
One shot.
That won't do much good hunting, nor to be rescued.
But after three weeks of a starving belly and thirst, that pistol looks real friendly.
But Jack escaped the island, and still has that single shot.
He won't use it, though, save on one man.
His mutinous first mate.
Barbossa.
Aye.
How did Jack get off the island?
I'll tell ye.
He waded out into the shallows, and waited three days and three nights, till all manner of sea creatures became acclimated to his presence.
On the fourth morning, he roped a couple of sea turtles, lashed them together and made a raft.
He roped a couple of sea turtles.
Aye.
What did he use for rope?
Human hair.
From my back.
Let go the anchor!
Lower the anchor line!
Young Mr. Turner and I are to go ashore.
Young Mr. Turner and I are to go ashore.
Captain.
What if the worst should happen?
Keep to the Code.
Aye.
The Code.
Ten years of hoarding swag.
Now we finally get to spend it.
Once we're quit of the curse, we'll be rich men... and you can buy an eye that fits and is made of glass.
This one does splinter something terrible.
Stop rubbing it.
What code is Gibbs to keep to if the worst should happen?
Pirates' Code.
Any man who falls behind is left behind.
No heroes amongst thieves.
For having such a bleak outlook on pirates you're well on your way to becoming one.
Sprung a man from jail, commandeered a ship of the fleet, sailed with a buccaneer crew out of Tortuga... and you're completely obsessed with treasure.
That's not true.
I am not obsessed with treasure.
Not all treasure is silver and gold, mate.
Gentlemen, the time has come!
Salvation is nigh!
Our torment is nearing an end!
Elizabeth.
For ten years we've been tested and tried and each man here has proved his mettle a hundred times over and a hundred times again!
Suffered, I have!
Punished we were, the lot of us, disproportionate to our crime!
Here it is!
The cursed treasure of Corts himself.
Every last piece that went astray, we have returned.
Save for this!
Jack!
Not yet.
We wait for the opportune moment.
When's that?
When it's of greatest profit to you?
May I ask you something?
Have I ever given you reason not to trust me?
Do us a favor.
I know it's difficult for you, but please stay here.
And try not to do anything stupid.
Who among us has paid the blood sacrifice owed to the heathen gods?
Us!
And whose blood must yet be paid?
Hers!
You know the first thing I'm going to do after the curse is lifted?
Eat a whole bushel of apples!
Begun by blood.
By blood undone.
Sorry, Jack.
I'm not going to be your leverage.
That's it?
Waste not.
Did it work?
I don't feel no different.
How do we tell?
You're not dead!
No.
He shot me.
It didn't work.
The curse is still upon us!
You!
Maid!
Your father, what was his name?
Was your father William Turner?
No.
Where's his child who sailed from England eight years ago?
The child in whose veins flows the blood of William Turner?
Where?
You two!
You brought us the wrong person!
No!
She had the medallion.
She's the proper age.
She said her name was Turner.
You heard her.
I think she lied to us.
You brought us here for nothing.
I won't take questioning, not from the likes of you, Master Twigg.
Who's to blame him?
Your decisions have led us from bad to worse!
It was you who sent Bootstrap to the depths!
And it's you who brought us here in the first place!
If any coward here dare challenge me, let him speak!
I say we cut her throat and spill all her blood.
Just in case.
Yeah!
The medallion!
She's taken it!
Get after her, you feckless pack of ingrates!
Where are the oars?
There's no oars!
The oars have gone missing!
Find them!
You!
You're supposed to be dead.
Am I not?
Pearlie... Palu-li-la-la-lulu... Parlili... Parsnip... Parsley...
Partner... Parley?
That's the one!
Parley!
Parley!
Parley?
Damn to the depths whatever muttonhead thought of parley!
That would be the French.
Not more pirates.
Welcome aboard, Miss Elizabeth.
Mr. Gibbs?
Hey, boy, where be Jack?
Jack Sparrow?
He fell behind.
Keep to the Code.
Weigh anchor!
Hoist the sails!
Split-quick, you dibbies!
How the blazes did you get off that island?
When you marooned me on that godforsaken spit of land, you forgot one very important thing.
I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.
Well, I won't be making that mistake again.
Gents, you all remember Captain Jack Sparrow?
Aye.
Kill him.
The girl's blood didn't work, did it?
Hold your fire!
You know whose blood we need.
I know whose blood you need.
What sort of a man trades a man's life for a ship?
A pirate.
Here.
Let me.
Thank you.
You said you gave Barbossa my name as yours.
Why?
I don't know.
I'm sorry.
A blacksmith's hands.
They're rough.
No.
I mean, yes, they are, but... Don't stop.
Elizabeth.
It's yours.
I thought I'd lost it the day they rescued me.
It was a gift from my father.
He sent it to me.
Why did you take it?
Because I was afraid that you were a pirate.
That would've been awful.
It wasn't your blood they needed.
It was my father's blood.
My blood.
The blood of a pirate.
Will, I'm so sorry.
Please forgive me.
So you expect to leave me on some beach with nothing but a name and your word it's the one I need, and watch you sail away in my ship.
No.
I expect to leave you standing on some beach with absolutely no name at all, watching me sail away on my ship, and then I'll shout the name back to you.
Savvy?
But that still leaves me standing on some beach, with naught but a name and your word it's the one I need.
Of the two of us, I am the only one who hasn't committed mutiny.
Therefore, my word is the one we'll be trusting.
Although, I suppose I should be thanking you because, in fact, if you hadn't betrayed me and left me to die, I would have an equal share in that curse, same as you.
Funny old world, isn't it?
Captain!
We're coming up on the Interceptor.
I'm having a thought here, Barbossa.
What say we run up a flag of truce, I scurry over to the Interceptor, and I negotiate the return of your medallion?
Now that's exactly the attitude that lost you the Pearl.
People are easier to search when they're dead.
Lock him in the brig.
Hands aloft to loose ta'gallants!
With this wind, she'll carry every sail we've got.
What's happening?
The Black Pearl is gaining on us!
This is the fastest ship in the Caribbean.
Tell them that after they've caught us.
We're shallower on the draft, right?
Aye.
Then can't we lose them on those shoals?
We don't have to outrun 'em long.
Just long enough.
Lighten the ship!
Stem to stern!
Anything we can afford to lose, see that it's lost!
Apparently, there's a leak.
Haul on the main brace!
Make ready the guns!
And run out the sweeps.
We're gonna need that.
It was a good plan, up till now.
Gibbs!
We have to make a stand.
We must fight!
Load the guns!
With what?
Anything!
Everything!
Anything we have left.
Load the guns!
Case shot and langrage!
Nails and crushed glass!
With a will!
The Pearl will luff up on our port quarter.
She'll rake us without presenting a target.
Lower the anchor on the right side.
On the starboard side!
It has the element of surprise.
You're daft, lady.
You both are.
Daft like Jack.
Lower the starboard anchor!
Do it, you gobs, or it's you we'll load into the cannons!
Let go!
They're club hauling.
Hard a port!
Rack the starboard oars!
Hard a port!
Keep her steady, man.
Now!
Fire!
Fire all!
Stop blowing holes in my ship!
We need more ideas, lass!
It's your turn!
We need us a devil's dowry!
We'll give them her!
She's not what they're after.
The medallion.
Strike your colors, you bloomin' cockroaches!
Hands, grapnels at the ready!
Prepare to board!
Pistols and cutlasses, men!
Koehler, Twigg, to the powder magazine!
And the rest of you, bring me the medallion!
Below!
Thanks very much.
Jack!
Bloody empty!
That's not very nice.
Where is the medallion?
Wretch!
Where is dear William?
Will.
Elizabeth!
Monkey!
I can't move it!
Elizabeth!
Thank you, Jack.
You're welcome.
Not you.
We named the monkey Jack.
Gents!
Our hope is restored!
Any of you so much as thinks the word "parley", I'll have your guts for garters!
Will.
You godless pirate!
Welcome back, miss.
You took advantage of our hospitality last time.
It holds fair now you return the favor.
Barbossa!
Will.
She goes free!
What's in your head, boy?
She goes free.
You've only got one shot, and we can't die.
Don't do anything stupid.
You can't.
I can.
Like that.
Who are you?
No one.
He's no one.
A distant cousin of my aunt's nephew, twice removed.
Lovely singing voice, though.
Eunuch.
My name is Will Turner!
My father was Bootstrap Bill Turner.
His blood runs in my veins.
It's the spitting image of old Bootstrap Bill come back to haunt us.
On my word, do as I say, or I'll pull this trigger, and be lost to Davy Jones' locker!
Name your terms, Mr. Turner.
Elizabeth goes free!
Yes, we know that one.
Anything else?
And the crew.
The crew are not to be harmed.
Agreed.
Barbossa, you lying bastard.
You swore she'd go free.
Don't dare impugn me honor, boy.
I agreed she'd go free.
It was you who failed to specify when or where.
Though it does seem a shame to lose something so fine, don't it, lads?
So I'll be havin' that dress back before you go.
I always liked you.
Goes with your black heart.
It's still warm.
Off you go.
Come on.
Too long.
I'd really rather hoped we were past all this.
Jack.
Jack!
Did you not notice?
That be the same island that we made you governor of on our last little trip.
I did notice.
Perhaps you'll be able to conjure up another miraculous escape.
But I doubt it.
Off you go.
Last time you left me a pistol with one shot.
By the powers, you're right.
Where be Jack's pistol?
Bring it forward.
Seeing as there's two of us, a gentleman would give us a pair of pistols.
It'll be one pistol as before, and you can be the gentleman and shoot the lady, and starve to death yourself.
That's the second time I've watched that man take my ship.
You were marooned on this island before.
We can escape in the same way.
To what point and purpose, young missy?
The Black Pearl is gone.
Unless you have a lot of sails hidden in that bodice...
Unlikely.
...young Mr. Turner will be dead long before you can reach him.
But you're Captain Jack Sparrow.
You vanished from under the eyes of seven agents of the East India Company.
You sacked Nassau port without even firing a shot.
Are you the pirate I've read about or not?
How did you escape last time?
Last time I was here a grand total of three days.
Last time... the rum runners used this island as a cache.
They came by and I was able to barter passage off.
From the looks of things, they've long been out of business.
You probably have your bloody friend Norrington to thank for that.
So that's it, then?
That's the secret, grand adventure of the infamous Jack Sparrow.
You spent three days lying on a beach drinking rum.
Welcome to the Caribbean, love.
We're devils, we're black sheep We're really bad eggs Drink up, me hearties, yo ho Yo ho, yo ho A pirate's life for me I love this song!
Really bad eggs!
When I get the Pearl back, I'm gonna teach it to the whole crew, and we'll sing it all the time.
You will be the most fearsome pirates in the Spanish Main.
Not just the Spanish Main, love.
The entire ocean.
The entire world!
Wherever we want to go, we go.
That's what a ship is.
It's not just a keel and a hull and a deck and sails.
That's what a ship needs.
But what a ship is... What the Black Pearl really is... is freedom.
Jack...
It must be really terrible for you to be trapped on this island.
Oh, yes.
But the company is infinitely better than last time.
And the scenery has definitely improved.
Mr. Sparrow!
I'm not entirely sure I've had enough rum to allow that kind of talk.
I know exactly what you mean, love.
To freedom!
To the Black Pearl!
No!
Not good!
Stop!
Not good!
What are you doing?
You've burned all the food, the shade, the rum.
Yes, the rum is gone.
Why is the rum gone?
One, because it is a vile drink that turns respectable men into scoundrels.
Two, that signal is over 1,000 feet high.
The entire Royal Navy is looking for me.
Do you think there is the slightest chance they won't see it?
But why is the rum gone?
Just wait, Captain Sparrow.
You give it one hour, maybe two, keep a weather eye open, and you will see white sails on that horizon.
"Must've been terrible for you to be trapped here, Jack."
Well, it bloody is now!
There'll be no living with her after this.
But we've got to save Will.
No.
You're safe now.
We will return to Port Royal immediately, not go gallivanting after pirates.
Then we condemn him to death.
The boy's fate is regrettable, but so is his decision to engage in piracy.
To rescue me.
To prevent anything from happening to me.
If I may be so bold as to interject my professional opinion.
The Pearl was listing to scuppers after the battle.
She won't make good time.
Think about it.
The Black Pearl.
The last real pirate threat in the Caribbean, mate.
How can you pass that up?
By remembering that I serve others, Mr. Sparrow, not only myself.
Commodore, I beg you, please do this for me.
As a wedding gift.
Elizabeth?
Are you accepting the Commodore's proposal?
I am.
A wedding.
I love weddings.
Drinks all around!
I know.
"Clap him in irons," right?
Mr. Sparrow, you will accompany these fine men to the helm and provide us with a bearing to Isla de Muerta.
Then contemplate all possible meanings of the phrase "silent as the grave".
Do I make myself clear?
Inescapably clear.
Shiver me timbers.
Cotton here says you missed a bit.
You knew William Turner.
Old Bootstrap Bill, we knew him.
Never sat well with Bootstrap, what we did to Jack Sparrow, the mutiny and all.
Never sat well with Bootstrap, what we did to Jack Sparrow, the mutiny and all.
He said it wasn't right with the Code.
That's why he sent off a piece of the treasure to you.
He said we deserved to be cursed, and remain cursed.
Stupid blighter.
Good man.
But, as you can imagine, that didn't sit too well with the Captain.
That didn't sit too well with the Captain at all.
Tell him what Barbossa did.
I'm telling the story!
So what the captain did, he strapped a cannon to Bootstrap's bootstraps.
Bootstrap's bootstraps!
Last we saw of old Bill Turner, he was sinking into the crushin' black oblivion of Davy Jones' locker!
It was only after that we learned we needed his blood to lift the curse.
That's what you call ironic.
Bring him.
I don't care for the situation.
Any attempt to storm the caves could turn into an ambush.
Not if you're the one doing the ambushing.
I go in and get Barbossa to send his men out in their little boats.
Your mates return to the Dauntless and blast them with your cannons.
What do you have to lose?
Nothing I'd lament being rid of.
Now, to be honest, there's a risk to those aboard the Dauntless, which includes the future Mrs. Commodore.
It's for your own safety.
I don't care, I have to tell him!
The pirates are cursed!
They can't be killed!
He's already informed of that.
A mermaid flopped up on deck and told the story.
This is Jack Sparrow's doing!
No reason to fret.
A prick of the finger, a few drops of blood... No mistakes this time.
He's only half-Turner.
We spill it all!
Guess there is reason to fret.
Beg your pardon.
Begun by blood.
By blood... Jack!
It's not possible.
Not probable.
Where's Elizabeth?
Safe, like I promised.
She's set to marry Norrington, like she promised, and you get to die for her like you promised.
So we're all men of our word, except for Elizabeth, who is a woman.
Shut up!
You're next!
You don't want to be doing that.
No, I think I do.
Your funeral.
Why don't I want to be doing it?
Because...
The HMS Dauntless, pride of the Royal Navy, is floating just offshore waiting for you.
What are we doing here?
The pirates come out, unprepared and unawares.
We catch 'em in a crossfire and send 'em down to see Old Hob.
I meant, why aren't we doing what Mr. Sparrow said we should do?
With the cannons and all?
Because it was Mr. Sparrow who said it.
You think he wasn't telling the truth?
Hear me out, mate.
Order your men to row out to the Dauntless, they do what they do best, Robert's your uncle, Fanny's your aunt...
There you are with two ships.
The makings of your own fleet.
You'll take the grandest as your flagship and who's to argue?
But what of the Pearl?
Name me captain, I'll sail under your colors and give you 10% of me plunder and you get to introduce yourself as Commodore Barbossa.
Savvy?
And in exchange you want me not to kill the whelp.
Not at all.
By all means, kill the whelp.
Just not yet.
Wait to lift the curse until the opportune moment.
For instance... after you've killed Norrington's men.
Every... last... one.
You've planned this ever since you learned my name.
Yeah.
I want 50% of your plunder.
15.
40.
I'll buy you the hat.
A really big one.
Commodore.
We have an accord.
All hands to the boats!
Apologies.
You give the orders.
Gents... take a walk!
Not to the boats?
Hold fire.
This is like what the Greeks done at Troy.
Except they was in a horse, instead of dresses.
Wooden horse.
A moment, please.
Elizabeth?
I want you to know I believe you made a very good decision today.
Couldn't be more proud of you.
But a good decision, if made for the wrong reasons, can be a wrong decision.
Lieutenant.
Elizabeth?
Are you there?
Are you even listening to me?
What have you done?
Stop that!
I already feel like a fool.
You look nice, though.
I look nice?
I must admit, Jack, I thought I had you figured but it turns out you're a hard man to predict.
I'm dishonest.
And a dishonest man you can trust to be dishonest.
Honestly, it's the honest ones you want to watch out for.
You can never predict when they're going to do something incredibly... stupid.
You're off the edge of the map, mate.
Here there be monsters!
Right.
What would you eat first?
We should decide now so we're ready when the time comes.
What was that?
Miss Elizabeth!
Make for the ship!
Move!
To the ship!
Row, men!
You can't beat me, Jack.
That's interesting.
I couldn't resist, mate.
Sorry!
What now, Jack Sparrow?
Are we to be two immortals, locked in an epic battle until Judgment Day?
Or you could surrender.
All of you with me.
Will is in that cave and we must save him.
Ready, and... heave!
I need your help.
Come on!
Any port in a storm.
Cotton's right.
We've got the Pearl.
Are you gonna leave Jack?
Jack owes us a ship.
There's the Code to consider.
The Code?
You're pirates.
Hang the Code and hang the rules!
They're more like guidelines.
Bloody pirates!
Is it supposed to be doing that?
They're stealing our ship.
Bloody pirates!
Boarders away.
Come on!
Me eye!
I'll teach you the meaning of pain.
You like pain?
Try wearing a corset.
Whose side is Jack on?
At the moment?
No fair!
Ten years you carry that pistol and now you waste your shot.
He didn't waste it.
I feel... cold.
Parley?
The ship is ours, gentlemen.
Huzzah!
Huzzah!
Huzzah!
We should return to the Dauntless.
Your fianc will want to know you're safe.
If you were waiting for the opportune moment... that was it.
Now, I'd be much obliged if you'd drop me off at my ship.
I'm sorry, Jack.
They done what's right by them.
Can't expect more than that.
Jack Sparrow... Captain Jack Sparrow.
...for your crimes against the Crown.
Said crimes being numerous in quantity and sinister in nature.
The most egregious of these to be cited herewith: Piracy, smuggling...
This is wrong.
Commodore Norrington is bound by the law, as are we all.
...impersonating an officer of the Spanish Royal Navy, impersonating a cleric of the Church of England, sailing under false colors, arson, kidnapping, looting, poaching, brigandage, pilfering, depravity, depredation and general lawlessness.
For these crimes, you are sentenced to be hung by the neck until dead.
May God have mercy on your soul.
Governor Swann.
Commodore.
Elizabeth.
I should have told you every day from the moment I met you...
I love you.
Watch yourself!
Marines!
I can't breathe.
Elizabeth!
Move!
I thought we might have to endure some ill-conceived escape attempt, but not from you.
On our return to Port Royal, I granted you clemency.
And this is how you thank me?
By throwing in your lot with him?
He's a pirate.
And a good man.
If this means the hangman will earn two pairs of boots instead of one, so be it.
My conscience will be clear.
You forget your place, Turner.
It's right here, between you and Jack.
As is mine.
Elizabeth.
Lower your weapons.
Put them down!
So this is where your heart truly lies?
It is.
I'm feeling good about this.
We've all arrived at a special place.
Spiritually, ecumenically, grammatically.
I want you to know that I was rooting for you, mate.
Know that.
Elizabeth.
It would never have worked between us, darling.
I'm sorry.
Will.
Nice hat.
Friends.
This is the day that you will always remember as the day that...
Idiot.
He's nowhere to go but back to the noose.
Sail ho!
What's your plan of action?
Sir!
Perhaps on the rare occasion, pursuing the right course demands an act of piracy.
Piracy itself can be the right course.
Mr. Turner.
I will accept the consequences of my actions.
This is a beautiful sword.
I expect the man who made it to show the same care and devotion in every aspect of his life.
Thank you.
Commodore!
What about Sparrow?
I think we can afford to give him one day's head start.
So...
This is the path you've chosen, is it?
After all, he is a blacksmith.
No.
He's a pirate.
Thought you were supposed to keep to the Code?
We figured they were more actual... guidelines.
Thank you.
Captain Sparrow.
The Black Pearl is yours.
On deck, you scabrous dogs!
Hands to braces!
Let go and haul to run free!
Now... bring me that horizon.
And really bad eggs Drink up, me hearties.
Yo ho!
Father's Curse.
DEAD or ALIVE.
THE FLYING DUTCHMAN Father.
Henry.
What have you done?
I said I'd find you.
Look at me, son.
I don't care!
There is no place for you on the Dutchman.
They know you're here... Get home to your mother.
No!
Leave now, before it's too late.
I won't!
I'll never stop... And if you throw me over, I'll come straight back.. Don't you see, I'm cursed to this ship?
That's why I'm here.
I think I know a way to break your curse.
To free you from the Dutchman.
Henry, no.
I've read about a treasure.
A treasure that holds all the power of the sea, The Trident of Poseidon, can break your curse.
Henry.
The Trident can never be found.
I found you.
It's just a tale.
Like the tales of you.
And Captain Jack Sparrow?
He will help me find the trident.
You stay away from Jack.
Leave the sea forever.
You've to stop acting like a.
A pirate.
I won't stop.
I want you to come home.
Henry.
I'm sorry.
My curse will never be broken.
This is my fate.
You must let me go.
I love you son.
Captain Jack Sparrow.
Nine years later..
Faster you pathetic built rats, you pump the builds.. And fill the scuppers.
We are chasing down pirates.
Henry get back here.
You don't wanna get kicked off an another ship.
It's a Dutch boat.
Probably stolen by the Pirate Bonet.
My God.
I warned you of leaving your post, boy.
I need to speak with the captain.
What did you say?
Move.
It is going in, sir.
Chase her down.
No, don't do it!
Don't do it.. You will not address a Captain, boy.
Sir, look at your charts.
I believe you're sailing us, in to the Devil's Triangle.
Do you hear this man?
This landsman, believes an old sailor's myth.
Sir.
With all due respect I have spent my life studying, the myths of the sea.
I know every legend and every curse.
Do I know, ships that sail into the triangle do not necessarily sail out.
Don't worry sir.
This one is clearly disturbed.
Sir, trust in what I say.
Change your course.
You dare to give me orders, boy?
Arrest him!
Turner!
I'll not let you kill us all.
Come on.
This is treason!
Lock him up.
No.
I'm going in.
This was your last chance, Turner.
If it were up to me, I would string you from the yard.
On deck!
Jack Sparrow.
He's dead.
Buried in an unmarked graveyard of St. Martin.
Sir, there's something in the water.
Ship to starboard!
That's no ship, sir.
It's a shipwreck.
No.
She's sailing straight towards us.
Open fire!
What are you?
Death.
WANTED!
JACK SPARROW.
Jack Sparrow.
Do you know this pirate?
Only by name.
You could look me for him?
Is that a yes?
Yes.
For too many years the Triangle has cursed us.
Condemned us to this Hell on Earth.
The key to our escape.. Is Jack Sparrow and the compass, which he holds.
No, no.
No need to fear me boy.
I always leave one man alive.
To tell the tale.
Find Sparrow for me and relay a message.
From Capitan Salazar.
Salazar.
Tell him I'll behold the daylight again.
And on that day.
Death.
Death.. comes straight for him.
Would you say that to him?
Please?
Yes.
I wish I could tell him myself, but.
Dead men tell no tales.
Previo: TamaBien.
SAN MARTIN, THE CARIBBEAN.
Carina Smyth.
You're an orphan, born of the devil.
Accused of practicing witchcraft.
Before you die.
Do you have anything to confess?
I confess that I am not a witch.
That I'm a woman of science.
I confess that I have survived on my own, with nothing but a dairy.
From a father I never knew.
On a quest for the truth of who I am.
I confess that I will die before I give up this search.
And I confess.
That while we've been talking.
I pitched this lock.
Today we dedicate The Royal Bank of St. Martin.
The most secure banking institution in the Caribbean.
Our new vault.. Is 5 inches thick.
And weighs an imperial ton.
I've got her!
Get her!
Don't let her get away.
Stop that witch!
With this bank, the town of St. Martin, enters the modern world.
I'm so sorry, sir.
The witch's get to the chains.
Find that wicked lass.
Or you swing in her place.
Sir.
Sir.
No man..
Nor army.
Can ever rob the gold from St. Martin.
Open the vault!
Pirate!
Pirate.?
Pirates!
This may seem a peculiar question.
Could someone explain to me.. To why I'm here?
How long?
No, no no, wait, it's coming to me.
Need just a moment to clear mi head.
Make ready!
Hold your fire.
There's a woman with him in the vault.
Sir, I believe... hat's your wife.
Francis?
Oh, I've got it!
I've got it.
I'm robbing the bank!
Shoot him!
That was not part of the plan.
Stop him!
Don't let him get away!
NO DOGS, NO WOMEN.
No woman has ever handled my... Clear the path.
No, no, no, no!
Stop, stop.. stop!
Hard to starboard!
Sir, your celestial fix was off.
I have adjusted two degrees north.
Your map will no longer be imprecise.
Although you will have to start again with it.
You're a witch.
No, I'm not.
Am I a witch for having cataloged.
Over 200 stars?
Witch!
There is a blood moon coming.
I simply need to purchase.
A chronometer.
I pay you double for selling to a woman.
Help me!
Help!
Help!
There is a witch in my shop.
And a pirate!
There is a witch and a pirate in my shop.
Well this is your lucky day!
Have either of the four of you seen my bank?
Found it.
Were you part of the plan?
I am not looking for trouble.
What a horrible way to live.
Stop that Witch!
Get her!
We're trapped.
What do we do?
You need to scream.
Over there!
Secure that woman!
You filthy pirate!
No need for lame calling!
Jack!
Bridge?
It's empty!
Where is the dash?
Do you think that robbing a bank is easy?
You gaggle of gutless use of the wound.. Guilty of putting me on this dreadful pickle in the first place.
Now line up.. And offer me a tribute.
Do you want us to pay you?
Am I not the captain of this ship?
You call this a ship?
Where is the treasure?
All of us are starving.
We'll no longer follow a captain without a ship.
I have a ship.
Black Pearl has never left mi side.
The pirate Barbarossa rules these seas now.
Has 10 ships.
Guns full.
Not to mention his canon balls.
18 pounds each they say.
One legged man with 18 pound balls?
That's why he walks funny.
Oh come, come mates?
Did we not find the treasure of Macedonia together?
It was a troll of rotten wood.
Gold of King Midas.
A pile of donkey dung.
Face it Jack.
Bad luck dogs you, day & night.
Now that is a bliss of fabrication.
You've lost your luck.
You've lost your ship.
Now.. you've lost your crew.
Jack Sparrow is no longer our captain.
I'm sorry Jack.
But we've reached the end of the horizon.
You're all dismissed.
Eh?
All of ya!
Dismissed!
Never sail with Captain Jack Sparrow again.
Tell you that.
The whole town speaks of you.
The only survivor of the Monarch.
A boy who pelled.. All the way to St Martin, against the tide.
On a piece of wood.
Now gibbering about pirates.
And tridents.
Please sir, let me go off these chains.
My job is to protect this island and these waters.
And your sleeves have been ripped, The mark of treason.
We were attacked by the dead.
You're a coward who ran from battle.
That is how you die.
I don't believe you're a coward.
Please leave me sister.
I've risked my life to come here.
To see if the rumors are true.
Are you speak of the Trident?
Who are you?
Tell me why you seek the trident?
The Trident can break, any curse at sea.
My father is trapped by such a curse.
You're aware that curses are not supported by science.
Neither the ghosts.
So you have gone mad?
I should never have come here.
Then why did you come here?
Because I need to get off this island.
To solve the map.
"No man can read".
Left by Poseidon himself.
You've read the ancient text?
In each language they were written.
But this map has never been seen or read, by any man.
Luckily I am a woman.
This is the diary of Galileo Galilei.
He's spent his life searching for the Trident, It's why he invented the spyglass.
Why astronomers' spend their lives staring in to the sky.
So you're saying the map no man can read, Is hidden in the stars?
It was left to me by my father.
He believe I could find.. What no man has ever found.
I will not let him down.
Soon, there will be blood moon.
Only then can the map be read.
And the Trident found.
Who are you?
Carina Smyth!
If you have to save your father, you'll have to save me.
Find us a ship.
And the Trident will be ours.
Come to me Witch!
Oh!
He's gone.!
He's gone sir.
Find that coward!
He will hang with the witch.
Think Capt.
Jack washed up right?
I have not had a wash in years.
Check the alley down there.
You two, check the church.
Rest of you, with me.
Bugger!
May I please have a drink, please?
Show me your silver.
Silver?
How about a trade?
Give me the bottle.
Capitan.
What's happening?
Jack Sparrow, Jack Sparrow has given away the compass.
Daylight!
We're free!
Now, now, it's time, to hunt a pirate.
Pirate's life.
Come to Daddy.
Just the man we've been looking for.
Why?
Why am I looked for?
Let it be known that the pirate Jack Sparrow.. Will be executed at dawn.
Executed?
I will never set foot in this town again, sir.
Be mark of words.
To release the power of the sea.
One must divide.
It's an island.
The stars lead to an island.
I'm looking for a pirate, Jack Sparrow.
Bugger off!
I need to speak with you.
Give me your sword.
I don't have a sword.
What kind of soldier has no weapon?
I'm counting on to the treason.
So, not a very good kind.
I am looking for a pirate, Captain Jack Sparrow?
Today is your lucky day.
Because I just happen to be.. Captain Jack Sparrow.
No, it can't be.
I've spent years searching for.. this?
The great Jack Sparrow is not some drunk in a cell.
Do you even have a ship?
A crew?
Pants.
A great pirate does not require such intricacies.
Do you know how long I've been waiting for this moment?
The risks I've taken to be here?
Are you sure you're the Jack Sparrow?
The real question is.. Who are you?
My name is Henry Turner.
Son of Will Turner and Elisabeth Swann.
You are the evil spawn of them two?
Does mommy ever ask about me?
No.
Go on.
She calls my name in the sleep?
She never spoke of you.
Are you sure we're talking about the same people?
He is a haste eunuch.
She has golden hair, stubborn, pouty lips.
Neck like a giraffe.
And two of the those wonderful.
Yes Yes, it's her.!
I need you to listen Jack.
Because at the moment you're all I have got.
I found the way to save my father.
There is one thing that can break his curse.
And free him from the Dutchmen.
The Trident of Poseidon.
The treasure that can be found with... the map that no man can read.
Never heard of it.
There's a girl inside this prison Jack, who holds that map.
The moon has time to blood, the trident will be found.
And you could be the one who holds the sea.
And with it become all that you once were.
The great.
Jack!
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Were you still talking?
One more thing.
A message from someone you know, named Captain Salazar.
I once knew a Spaniard named.
Something in Spanish.
El Matador Del Mar.
The butcher of the sea.
Him?
No, no, no.
Quite happily he's dead.
Very, very dead.
Ship went down..
Inside the triangle.
He's coming for you Jack, to seek revenge.
As the dead man's tale is told..
I don't believe you.
What did he say?
He said your compass was the key, his escape.
An army of dead, are coming straight for you, Jack.
The Trident of Poseidon is your only hope.
Do we have an accord?
I am not going in there to tell him.
It was your idea!
No, it was my idea for you to tell him.
He likes you more than me.
He doesn't like anybody.
Sorry sir.
We know you said never to disturb you.
Or to come in without good cause.
Or to speak without first.
To ask you now whether our, thoughts were absolutely necessary.
Like the time the ship was on fire.
That being an example of necessary thought.
So again, we do apologize for starting that fire.
Speak!
It's the ships, sir.
They are being attacked by an enemy.. That takes the Riches.
Kills without provocation.
My ships?
Not possible!
Three of them already been sunk, Sir.
They have been sunk by a captain called Salamander!
Sandoval.
Salazar!
That's him, your sireness!
He leaves one man from each vessel.. To tell the tale.
The entire fleet is being sunk.
And we'll soon be dead.
And quite possibly out of business.
I'll be needing some time with your witch..
I have been expecting you Captain.
Perhaps you would like some tea.
I shall pass, thank you kindly.
The price of crossing my door is blood, Captain.
That explains why you're not so busy.
Everyone pays, eventually.
Shansa, you and I made a bond long ago.
I saved you from the gallows.
Remember?
And I cursed your enemies.
But now you come to me with fear.
As the dead have taken command over the sea.
And what would the dead be wanting with me?
Not you, Captain.
They're searching for a Sparrow.
Jack?
Jack who sails for the trident.. With a girl and a Pearl.
The trident can never be found.
The trident is Jack's only hope.
The dead are conquering the sea, unable to step on dry land.
Maybe you should retire to the country side.
You mean grass?
On a farm?
Milking a cow, making cheese.
While they sink mi treasure?
Ask yourself this, Captain.
Is this treasure worth dying for?
I'm a pirate.
Always will be!
So how do I save, what be mine.
Jack held a compass.
Which points you to the thing you desire most.
But betray the compass... And it releases your greatest fear.
And a pirate's greatest fear will be Salazar, is it?
How did you get this?
I have my ways.
Lead them to Jack before he finds the trident.
And all your treasure will come back to you.
Time to make a deal with the dead.
Come on, pirate.
Hold on, stop.
Uncle Jack!
Jackie boy, how is it going?
Can't complain really.
You?
I've been waiting all morning in here, for a beating.
But the service is terrible.
Shameful.
Jack.
The oceans have turned to blood.
Best to stay on dry land, where it's safe.
I'm about to be executed on dry land.
Good point.
Did I ever told you about the skeleton?
Yes you have, many times.
Skeleton goes into a bar, orders a beer.
And a mop.
Funny as ever.
Come on let's go!
If they disembowel you, ask for Viktor.
He's got the softest hands.
Thank you.
And mention my name, they won't cut your feet off.
Come on.
You're first!
And how would you like to die pirate?
Hanging, firing squad or a new invention.
The guillotine.
Guillotine?
Sounds french.
I love the French.
Did you know they've invented mayonnaise?
How bad could it be?
It's French, right?
Oh, my bad!
I change mi mind.. No please have mercy for me.
I am a bet wetter.
Oh, come on!
I mean I have to walk upstairs as well for this?
Bring the basket.
Basket.. why?
Step him down!
Here's an idea.
Why don't we try good old fashioned stoning?
I'd kill to be stoned right now.
Gets the crowd involved, doesn't it?
I should like to speak to Victor in disembowelment.
I should like to speak to Vic.
I'm not the one who, complain normally, but this basket is full of heads.
Final words of Carina Smyth.
Shut up!
The final words of Carina Smyth.
It says.
I'm not a witch.
But I forgive your common dim witlessness and feeble brains.
In short, most of you have the mind of a goat.
Pardon me sir.
It's not common practice... for those about to be executed.
To be granted a last, I don't know, some of a..?
I believe I was making a point.
If you could just be patient.
No.
My head's about to be lopped off.
Hence the urgency.
And my neck is to be broken.
Did you know that on occasion, the neck doesn't actually break.
It just hurts.
What?
Oh Yes.
I have seen men swing for hours.
Eyes bulging, tongues swelling.
Revolting gurgling sound.
May I finish?
No.
You're lucky.
Wish I was hung.
Kill the filthy pirate, I'll wait..
The witch is first.
I'm not a witch.
Did not you listen?
Quite hard to listen when you have the mind of a goat.
Enough!
Kill them both.
Yes!
Guess another news.
Did you think you could defeat us boy?
No sir, I'm just a diversion.
Fire!
I still rather be stoned.
Reload!
Thank you.
Come here.
You Pirate Scum!
Hey!
What do you do?
No, no, no, no!
Horses?
Thank you.
You're welcome Mi lady.
Got you!
Who you'd come tolling back traitor?
The Turner boy gave us.. 10 pieces of silver to save your neck.
From this moment on we're to be allies.
Considering where your left hand is.
I'd say we're more than that.
We'd find the Trident together.
Do I have your word?
You're holding everything but my word.
Then I bestow upon you the honor of saving me.
For a small donation.
You expect us to pay you to save you?
Yes!
For a mere 10 pieces.
Madness!
We won't more than 5.
Well, then.
8 it is.
Perhaps we could discuss this later.
As I am having trouble here wasting your... That is my stern.
Are you sure?
Positive.
Well, look at this.
If I kill the coward.
The witch hangs.
Two for the price of one.
Please don't let go of me.
It might be difficult once he kills me.
Gentlemen, these two prisoners will lead us, to the trident.
Captain.
Do you really think we can find the trident?
Master Gibbs, you're worrywart.
There is nothing to be concerned about.
What could possibly go wrong, right?
So this was your plan?
To be tortured and killed by pirates?
You said you needed a ship.
You call this a ship?
Cut the string!
Prepare them.
My dear beloved crew.
Finally... Today is..
DYING GULL.
Something's gone wrong.
She floats!
Ship dead ahead.
Sir.
We would never question your reason as a captain.
But, however.. Is there a reason as captain, you've chosen.. To sail in this unreasonable direction?
Tell the men to prepare to be boarded.
To stand their ground.
And show no fear.
Capitan!
A ship sails towards us.
Captain Salazar.
I hear you've been looking for Jack Sparrow.
Hold point!
And await orders.
My name is Captain Barbarossa.
And I stand before you, with cordial intent.
I don't need any cordial intent.
Do you hear that?
This pirate wishes to be cordial.
So let me show you what my cordiality is.
Every time I tap my sword.
One of your men will die, So I suggest you speak quickly.
Might want to go a bit faster Captain.
Where is Jack Sparrow?
Jack be sailing for the trident.
No.
The sea belongs to the dead.
The Trident controls the seas.
No, no.
There is no treasure.
There is no treasure.
I can't save him.
He'll die with you.
I be the only one that can lead you to him.
I declare you should have Jack's life by sunrise tomorrow.
Or you can take me on then.
Do we have an accord?
Tail me to him.
And you will live to tell the tale.
You have my word.
I thank you on behalf of my crew.
Okay.
You can take what's left them.
The living come aboard.
Carina, we haven't got much time, the dead are sailing straight for us.
Is that so?
Yes, I've spoken to them.
You spoken to them?
Have you spoken to the Krakens and the mermaids as well?
Krakens don't speak, everyone knows that.
Of course, I never should have saved you.
Last night there was a blood moon, just as you described.
Tell me what to reveal.
And why should I trust you?
You trusted me to hold your porch, remember?
It was my stern.
Clearly you need to spend more time at sea.
Tell me what you found and I promise to help you.
I don't need any help.
Then why did come to me Carina?
Why are we together in the middle of the sea.. Chasing the same treasure?
The moon revealed a clue.. To release the power of the sea.
One must divide.
Divide?
What does it mean?
I'm not sure yet.
Then we'll find out.
There is no map in this map.
Give me my diary.
Give me the map no man can read.
If you could read it.
Then it wouldn't be call the map that no man can read.
I beg you please, don't argue with her.
Most of the men on this ship can't read.
Which makes all maps.
Maps that no man can read.
Well if you can't read it, then you've no use for it, or me.
Let me start again.
Show me the map.
I can't.
It does not even exist.
She's a witch!
I'm an astronomer.
She breeds donkeys.
What?
No.
An astronomer contemplates the sky.
Yay, on a donkey.
No, there's no donkey!
Well then how do you breed then?
Allows me to simplify this equation.
Give me the map.
Or I'll kill.. him, or kill him.
Go on then.
You're bluffing.
And you're blushing.
Throw him over.
We call this keel hauling.
Young Henry will be tossed over.
And he will be dragged under the ship.
Alright.
What're you waiting for?
He doesn't appear to be.
No.
Not bluffing me.
He's trying to say something.
No, no, we don't have any food on board.
Sorry.
If he's lucky, he'll drown, before the barnacles shred him to ribbon.
Bernacles.
Like a thousands knives, across your back.
And of course, the blood attracts sharks.
Sharks?
Shark of the bow!
Where?
I would say that swimming is no longer his primary concern.
The map is there.
Where?
On the tip of your finger?
No.
In the heavens.
That dairy will lead me to a map, hidden in the stars.
Let him up, I'll find it tonight.
Sorry, can't bring him up.
Look for yourself.
As I said.. Blushing!
Filthy pirate!
The sea has turned to blood, a sailor washed ashore.. Talking about the Trident.
He was looking for Jack Sparrow.
The same pirate who saved a witch from the gallows.
She's no Witch.
But you are.
And you're going to help us.
You afraid, Lieutenant?
As ships burning the night, you want to know if you can save your own.
If the trident is real?
You are going to read that wall for me.
Or you will die.
The British Empire will have..
The trident and rule the sea.
I want to know where that pirate is going, with that witch.
Your destiny is in these stars.
I will set your course.
No Spaghetti walls.
Why did I bother coming to you?
The dead are haunting us down and you do nothing.
Nothing, You call this nothing?
You're drunk and you're sleeping.
My point exactly, I am doing two things at once.
You can't save the unsavable mate.
Like it or not Jack, you're going to help me.
I will break my father's curse.
Next time you raise a sword, boy.
Be the last to die.
Might I suggest you entice her with a bit of flattery.
I am here for my father, nothing more.
I knew it, absolutely smitten with that.
Now, bit of discretion when goes into brunette.
Never presume her sister.
But if you can not avoid the charming sister.
Kill the brother, savvy?
No, I do not savvy.
Who hurt you?
By the way that little slim of knowledge.
Has cost you five pieces.
I am not paying you for that.
Never say that to a woman.
Just because you can't see something does not mean it's not there.
Like the map?
We have to find it.
It's the only link to who I am.
Who my father was.
So we both spent our lives, searching for our fathers.
Perhaps you and I are closer than you think.
The sun is up.
And so is up time.
I'm not to disagree, but the precision of our accord, Ends at sunrise.
This be will light, far from a fully rising sun.
And I know you to be a man of honor.
Honor, you know nothing of me.
I know what it likes to be bested by Jack Sparrow.
He's an enemy to us both.
You don't know who I am.
I've heard stories of a mighty Spanish captain.
El Matador Del Mar.
A man who skirts the sea.
Hunted and killed thousands of men.
No, no, no.
Men, no, no.
No.
Pirates!
Eh?
Pirates.
Pirates had infected the seas for generations.
Taken the life of my father and his father before.
So I vowed to end this plague once and for all.
And that's what I did, I destroyed dozens of ships.
The last ones joined together to try and defeat me.
But they soon realized it was hopeless.
Nothing could stop the Silent Mary.
Hit them below the water line.
Vamo, vamo!
Hang on tight!
The sea was finally.. pure.
Their wretched flags will no longer stain the sea.
They are begging for mercy.
Mercy?
There's no mercy.
Make ready.
Adios!
Fire!
It's up to you now Jack.
This compass.. points towards what you want most.
Never betray it.
The Devil's Triangle.
The last of their ships were burning before my eyes.
And in that moment of... Victori.
It's when I heard it.
Hey!
Hold on, One ship was trying to escape through the smoke.
It's a lovely day for a sail, ain't it?
And there.
In the crow's nest, there was this young pirate boy.
The way I see it, it just the two of us left.
If you surrender to me now, I'll let you live, simple.
He stood there, looking like.
A little bird.. And from that day he earned himself a name that would... haunt me for the rest of my days.
Jack de "Sparrow".
Right, you surrender to me now, and I'll let you live.
I shall let you live.
This boy.
This boy was mocking my power.
So I test him.
Knowing that I would run.. My knife along his neck, and when he was dead, I would finish finally.. With pirates's life.
Follow him men!
To the gutholes.
Thread some lines.
Prepare the boot leg!
Port side.
Throw it now.
They're turning around.
What's all this?
Tribute... Sir.
He took everything from me.
And filled me with.. rage.
And pain.
And he is where the tale ends.
Not yet Capitan, there.
Found as promised.
So she's saying she's got the map, but she's the only one who can follow it?
So we should...?
Leave her be.
She will take us to the Trident.
You've been saying that for hours.
Two things we know are true, the stars don't shine by day.
And she forgot a donkey.
How can we go to a spot, where no land exists on any map?
This chronometer keeps the exact time in London.
I'm using it to make an altitude measurement.. To determine longitude.
Only then will we find our exact spot to see.
So you expect to find the trident with a timepiece?
Yes.
My calculations are precise and true.
I'm not only an Astronomer.
I am also a horologist.
No shame in that dear.
We'll all have to earn a living, eh?
No, I'm a horologist.
So was my mum.
But she didn't cry a bad as lad as you.
You saying your mother was academically inclined?
More like a horizontally, reclined.
Horology is the study of time.
And she was always looking at watch.
I can vouch for that.
So no one can find the X, but you, right?
No.
And the donkey?
Ship to the f!
Salazar.
Jack, the dead will not rest until they get their revenge.
Dead?
No, no, the dead.
Were never part of this deal.
We should've never follow.
A luck less pirate and a witch to sea.
Right, that's it.
Kill them all.
Kill me and, and..
I will be dead.
And then the other dead won't be able to have the revenge.
Against me, I'd be dead.
What?
Which will anger them even more.
He's right.
That's right.
Are all pirates this stupid?
Yes.
What are we going to do?
As Captain.
Might I suggest.
Mutiny?
You had to suggest a mutiny?
Carina, the dead are coming.
Well.
I choose not to believe in supernatural nonsense.
Do you not see what's behind us?
Drop them!
Si.
Drop them!
What are you doing?
Men on that ship are looking for Jack.
And Jack is on this boat.
I'm going to swim for it.
How dare you do exactly what I'd do if I were you?
Carina stop!
No, no, no, don't stop.
This has gone far enough.
No, it has not.
Listen not to him, carry on, carry on.
Why, she was almost finished.
I saw her ankles.
You'd have to seen a lot more, if you kept the cakeholes shut.
Kill the sparrow.
That's not good, is it?
Keep rowing man.
Faster!
No, that's it.
I'm going with her.
You would leave me for some horologist in her knickers?
Yes.
You men are all alike.
Shark.
Henry!
Doesn't seem to be working.
No, we'll be fine, we'll be fine.
How did they do that?
We have to swim.
I will distract him.
Now!
Henry!
Hi.. Jack Sparrow.
Jack Sparrow.
Spanish?
Ghosts.
Ah-ow.
They are unable to step on land.
I knew that.
Ghosts!
Carina!
You will soon pay for what you did to me.
No no no.
There is no need to bother really.
Carina!
I have no time to chat.
Because mi map just ran away.
I'll be waiting for you.
Why would you be waiting for me?
Why would he be waiting for me?
Pirates!
Scrum.
Captain?
Jack always told me that if anything should ever happened to him.
He wanted you to be captain.
Yes, but the men voted for you, yes?
Well, you've got a captain's hat!
"Be that as it may" them were his wishes.
So be a good lad and take the wheel.
And.. you, Take the captain's hat.
Perish my rhythm.
We will beat your captain to death.
Until he reveals where they are heading.
Carina!
I know what's ailing you boy.
You've got the unstretchable itch.
Carina is the only one who can help us find the Trident.
And I'm not in love with her.
Love?
Who said anything about love, what are you talking about?
The unstretchable itch.
Scabies, I'm talking about scabies.
Small mites that burrow under the skin.
Certainly annoying me, has done for years.
Oh, no!
Hangman's Bay, STRANGERS NOT WELCOME.
Help!
Help me!
Help!
Carina!
Henry, help me.
Help her!
By rule of the King.
I sentence you all to death.
I think we should tell each other where our treasures are buried.. Just in case one of us survives.
Oh, good idea.
You go first.
My treasure is buried..
Between two cross palm trees in an unmarked grave in Aruba.
What about yours?
I haven't got any.
You promised me Jack's blood.
But Jack is trapped!
He can never escape the island.
Piece of land.
Hello.
I upheld our deal.
Mi men and myself will go ashore.
The traitor will be yours.
On mi honor.
Honor?
What honor, hombre?
What honor?
You don't know what the honor is.
Spare mi my life.
And I'll fetch you little Sparrow.
An accord?
Wake up Sparrow.
Wake up Sparrow.
Wake up, Sparrow.
It's time to pay your debt.
Pig?
Pig Kelly?
Mi old mate.
Mate?
Do you hear that boys?
This pirate owes me a blunder of silver.
And luck has brought him to Hangman's Bay.
Where he can settle his debt, here and now.
And I will, I will Pig.
Name your price.
Her name is Beatrice.
And she is my poor widowed sister.
What, what is that?
She's been looking for a respectable man.
But you'll have to do.
Royce, let's get on with this.
No why?
Why..?
To make an honest woman of her, Jack.
Congratulations, it's your wedding day.
Let us begin?
We will honeymoon in the barn.
No, no, no.
Pig.
How can I honestly make an honest woman out of it?
That, her.
I mean.
Her.
What are those things?
Our children.
Best not look them in the eye.
Bring the best man and the bridesmaid.
I looked it in the eye.
Place your hand on the Bible.
I have got scabies.
So do I.
Place your hand on the Bible.
I'm a bed wetter.
Say I do.
Or I'll put a bullet in your skull.
Jack, they are going to kill us.
I don't care!
Just say I do.
Last chance Jack.
Wait.
Surely..
This is not legal.
This is not legal.
He's right.
Does any man here object to the nuptials?
I do.
Congratulations.
You may kiss the bride.
Do you like seafood, do you?
Jack.
We meet again.
Hector!
This is mi best as my in the whole world.
I always knew you'll settle down, eventually.
Did you bring me a gift?
That'll do.
You look marvelous.
Got quite a spring in your step.
Has your leg grown back?
Captain, shouldn't we be getting back to Salazar.
Trade Mr. Sparrow's life in for our own?
I know that we could.
But I've come for the Trident Poseidon.
You're gonna double cross the dead?
You did promise!
And with it I'll gut the dead that stole my command of the sea.
As much as I love this plan.
No vessel can outrun that wretched haul of the ship.
But there be one, Jack.
The fastest ship I know.
The pearl, trapped in that bottle by Blackbeard.
Five winters ago.
By the power of that blaggerd sovereign blade..
I hereby release the Black Pearl, to her former and rightful glory.
Get rid of the..
It's coming.
It is coming!
It is coming!
Coming!
Set aside.
It's coming!
It's shrunken.
Why doesn't it unshrink?
Maybe it's cold.
She needs the sea.
She was a fine ship.
There be room for only one captain.
Filthy beast.
Time to race the dead.
The only safe place is the land.
Why are we going away from the land?
Nobody knows?
Captain, your map is incomplete.
I can take us to the Trident, if you'd only trust me.
Did you not hear anything I just said?
So you be saying.
Is that star pretending to be a map?
Sir, there is no island, on any map, to support what the woman says.
Captain, you don't have to understand her.
Just believe her.
Any one?
We had something sharp, I could pick that lock.
You are not gonna find anything sharp in here.
Release them.
Sir, you wouldn't allow a woman to steer your ship?
She will follow her star.
Or we'll all die together.
The Black Pearl.
She sails again.
Yeah!
This ship.
Those ghosts.
There can be no logical explanation.
Myths of the sea are real, Carina.
I'm glad you can finally see you were wrong.
Wrong?
Perhaps I had some doubts.
This is the worst apology I've ever heard.
Apology?
Why would I apologize?
Because we've been chased by the dead, sailing on a ship, raised from a bottle.
Where is your science in that?
Fine, I will apologize.
Go on, then.
Well then, one could argue that you owe me an apology.
As my life has been threatened by pirates and dead man.
Which you now believe in, sorry to say.
Apology accepted.
I am going to the lookout.
I'm glad you see it my way!
Ready the guns.
Aye.
Ready the guns!
These pirates are going for the trident.
Where did you get that from Missy?
I know this book, stolen from an Italian ship, many years ago.
Stolen?
No, you're mistaken.
There was a Ruby on the cover...
I would not soon forget.
This was given to me by my father.
He was clearly a man of science.
He was clearly a common thief.
The memory of my father will not be befouled... by the tongue of a pirate.
This diary is my birth right.
Left to me on the steps of a children's home.
Along with a name and nothing else.
Oh, so you are an orphan?
What be you called?
Brightest star in the North gave me my name.
That would be Carina?
Carina Smyth.
So, you do know your stars?
I'm a captain.
I know which stars to follow home.
Smyth?
Smyth is quite an unusual name.
Did we not once know someone, old Smyth?
Shut your trip.
What was her name.
It's right on the tip of mi tongue.. Do you wanna loose that tongue?
Margaret Smyth.
Aye, so we making accord then?
Or, Shall I tell you know who.. What we both know it's the truth.
We both take the secret to our grave.
You mean, it is true?
I was bluffing.
I am not!
You kill me, you got nothing to bow to the deadness.
So you need me.
I will have to frank Hector.
You are very, very ugly.
So how could you produce a fetching creature such as that?
Margaret died.
That worthless blaggerd ever could.
I placed the infant in an orphanage, never to see her again.
I thought the ruby might afford her some easy life..
But I never imagined she would take those scribblings.. Make a life of her own.
Life that's led her back to me.
I would say this puts me in a rather favorable position, Daddy.
Tell me what you want.
I want mi compass.
216 barrels of rum.
And a monkey.
You want Jack?
Dinner.
I want to eat him.
I want to eat that monkey.
No deal Jack.
A clever young woman such as that, would never believe that a swine like me could ever be her blood.
And the Tridente will be mine.
Redcoats.
Redcoats!
Prepare to fire!
Prepare to fire.
She comes starboard.
We shall fight to the last.
The pearl will not be taken from me again.. Sir.
Only the British Empire will hold the power of the sea.
What ever happens, stay your course.
Jack Sparrow?
I've come with the butcher's bill.
Where is he?
Defend yourselves men!
Till again!
Hurry up man, what did you... sharpen it with butter?
There is nowhere to hide.
Let's be brave, save the Pearl.
This has to be it.
It has to be here.
Sail that land.
Oh mi Lord's eye.
We're nearly there.
It's here somewhere.
Have you found what you were looking for yet, miss?
I'm trying!
The stars will soon be gone.
Carina!
Henry!
Look, the island is there.
You found it!
The island.
Land!
Get to the.. Carina!
Carina!
Henry!
They took Henry!
The trident be all that can save him now.
Then we have to find it.
Where is it?
It has to be here.
Look at it Jack.
It's most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
This is what my father wanted to find.
The rocks?
No, no.
Not rocks, stars.
This is the map no man can read.
This island is a perfect reflection of the heavens.
One star's missing, quickly.
We have to find the trident to save Henry.
Hector.
I think you should know she's a horologist.
Why is not it glowing?
Finish it, Carina.
The missing star.
For my father.
Aye.. Do it for him.
There.
Posiedon's tomb.
This way.
Capitan.
You know the danger.
Don't do it!
We have no choice.
Jack is on land going for the trident.
Capitan, there must be another way.
Once you possess the living, there is no coming back.
You will be trapped in his body.
Forever.
The Tridente will set me free.
Time to kill a sparrow.
No!
Look Jack, there it is.
The trident.
Jack!
You cut me, you cut the boy Jack.
Henry!
No.
Hola, Sparrow.
No.
Sparrow, Sparrow.
No.
Henry, you've woken him up Please.
Henry wake up!
Oh, piss off!
Henry wakes up, he is killing Jack.
Henry!
Power of the sea.
What?
The power of the sea.
To release the power of the sea.. All must divide.
If the trident holds all the power, then.
Then every curse is held inside.
As I told you before.
Surrender to me now.
And I will let you.
Live.
Do you want me to surrender?
Maybe.
This is where the trail ends.
No!
Divide.
Henry!
Divide.
Break.
Break the trident and you'll break off the curses of the sea.
Adios, Sparrow.
All curses have broken.
Yes!
The Pearl!
My Pearl!
Climb.
Move, fast!
Hold it steady boys, don't let it slip.
Jack!
Faster!
Lift, anchor!
Get the anchor up, quick!
Stop, stop, bring it up.
Bring it up!
Capitan!
Oh, crap!
I've got ya.
Who am I to you?
Treasure.
Hold on!
Hector!
Go to starboard!
Pirate's life, Hector.
You were right?
I don't know.
For a moment I had everything Henry.
Now it's all gone again.
It's not all gone, Smyth.
Barbarossa... My name is Barbarossa.
Maybe Jack was right.
About what?
You unstretchable itch.
Why did you do that for?
Just checking it's truly you.
That you are not still cursed.
It's me.
Then I was.. Wrong.
Slightly an error.
Although one.
Apology accepted.
The Dutchman.
Henry?
Yes father.
Oh, look at you son.
How did you do it?
How did you break the curse?
Let me tell you a tale.
The tale of the greatest treasure known to man.
That's the tale I wanna hear.
What a silly revolting sight.
Make way!
Captain Jack Sparrow on deck...
Indeed.
Welcome back, Captain.
I thank you very much, coming through.
Captain!
Thank you, I remember you.
Cheers, thank you.
Oh good!
Master Gibbs.
The ship is yours Captain.
Aye, thank you!
Monkey.
Thank you!
What be aye heading captain?
We should follow the stars, Master Gibbs.
Aye.. aye, Captain!
I have a rendezvous beyond my.. Beloved horizon.
Will!
Why is this happening?
I don't know.
You look beautiful.
It's bad luck for the groom to see the bride before the wedding.
Make way!
Let me through!
How dare you!
Stand your men down at once.
Do you hear me?
Governor Weatherby Swann, it's been too long.
Cutler Beckett?
It's Lord now, actually.
Lord or not, you have no reason and no authority to arrest this man.
In fact, I do.
Mr. Mercer?
The warrant for the arrest of one William Turner.
This warrant is for Elizabeth Swann.
Oh, is it?
That's annoying.
My mistake.
Arrest her.
On what charges?
Aha.
Here's the one for William Turner.
And I have another one for a Mr. James Norrington.
Is he present?
What are the charges?
Commodore Norrington resigned his commission some months ago.
That wasn't the answer to the question I asked.
Lord Beckett.
In the category of questions not answered... We are under the jurisdiction of the king's governor of Port Royal and you will tell us what we are charged with.
The charge is "conspiring to set free "a man convicted of crimes against the Crown and Empire "and condemned to death, for which the..." For which the punishment, regrettably, is also death.
Perhaps you remember a certain pirate named Jack Sparrow.
Captain.
Captain Jack Sparrow.
Captain Jack Sparrow.
Yes, I thought you might.
# Fifteen men on a dead man's chest # Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum # Drink and the devil had done for the rest # Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum Prisoners, come on!
Sorry, mate.
Mind if we make a little side trip?
I didn't think so.
Not quite according to plan.
Complications arose, ensued, were overcome.
You got what you went in for, then?
Mm-hm.
Captain, I think the crew, meaning me as well, were expecting something a bit more... shiny, with the Isla de Muerta going pear-shaped, reclaimed by the sea with the treasure.
And the Royal Navy chasing us around the Atlantic.
And the hurricane.
Aye.
All in all, it seems some time since we did a speck of honest pirating.
Shiny.
Aye, shiny.
Is that how you're all feeling?
That perhaps dear old Jack is not serving your best interests as captain?
Walk the plank.
What did the bird say?
Do not blame the bird.
Show us what is on that piece of cloth there.
You know that don't do no good.
It does me.
It's a key.
No.
Much more better.
It is a drawing of a key.
Gentlemen, what do keys do?
Keys... unlock things?
And whatever this key unlocks, inside there's something valuable.
So we're setting out to find whatever this key unlocks.
No.
If we don't have the key, we can't open whatever we don't have that it unlocks.
So what purpose would be served in finding whatever need be unlocked, which we don't have, without first having found the key what unlocks it?
So we're going after this key.
You're not making any sense at all.
Any more questions?
So... do we have a heading?
Ha.
A heading.
Set sail in a... general... that-way direction.
Captain?
Come on, snap to and make sail.
You know how this works.
Go on.
Oi, oi, oi!
Have you noticed lately the captain seems to be acting a bit strange... er?
Setting sail without knowing his own heading.
Something's got Jack vexed, and mark my words, what bodes ill for Jack Sparrow bodes ill for us all.
Lord Beckett, the prisoner as ordered, sir.
Those won't be necessary.
The East India Trading Company has need of your services.
We wish for you to act as our agent in a business transaction with our mutual friend Captain Sparrow.
More acquaintance.
How do you know him?
We've had dealings in the past.
And we've each left our mark on the other.
What mark did he leave on you?
By your efforts, Jack Sparrow was set free.
I would like you to go to him and recover a certain property in his possession.
Recover.
At the point of a sword?
Bargain.
Letters of marque.
You will offer what amounts to a full pardon.
Jack will be free, a privateer in the employ of England.
Somehow I doubt Jack will consider employment the same as being free.
Freedom.
Jack Sparrow is a dying breed.
The world is shrinking, the blank edges of the map filled in.
Jack must find his place in the New World or perish.
Not unlike you, Mr. Turner.
You and your fiance face the hangman's noose.
So you get Jack and the Black Pearl.
The Black Pearl?
The property you want that he possesses.
A ship?
Hardly.
The item in question is considerably smaller and far more valuable, something Sparrow keeps on his person at all times.
A compass?
Ah, you know it.
Bring back that compass or there's no deal.
Why is the rum always gone?
Oh.
That's why.
As you were, gents.
Ah.
Time's run out, Jack.
Bootstrap.
Bill Turner.
You look good, Jack.
Is this a dream?
No.
I thought not.
If it were, there'd be rum.
You got the Pearl back, I see.
I had some help retrieving the Pearl, by the way.
Your son.
William?
He ended up a pirate after all.
And to what do I owe the pleasure of your carbuncle?
He sent me.
Davy Jones.
Oh.
So it's you, then.
He shanghaied you into service, eh?
I chose it.
I'm sorry for the part I played in the mutiny against you, Jack.
I stood up for you.
Everything went wrong after that.
They strapped me to a cannon.
I ended up on the bottom of the ocean, the weight of the water crushing down on me.
Unable to move.
Unable to die, Jack.
And I thought that even the tiniest hope of escaping this fate, I would take it.
I would trade anything for it.
It's funny what a man will do to forestall his final judgment.
You made a deal with him too, Jack.
He raised the Pearl from the depths for you.
13 years, you've been her captain.
Technically... Jack.
You won't be able to talk yourself out of this.
The terms what applied to me apply to you as well.
One soul bound to crew 100 years upon his ship.
The Flying Dutchman already has a captain... Then it's the locker for you!
Jones's terrible leviathan will find you and drag the Pearl back to the depths and you along with it.
Any idea when Jones might release said terrible beastie?
I already told you, Jack.
Your time is up.
It comes now, drawn with ravenous hunger to the man what bears the black spot.
On deck, all hands!
Make fast the bunt gasket!
On deck!
Scurry!
Scurry!
I want movement!
Movement!
I want movement!
Lift the skin up!
Keep your loof!
Haul those sheets!
Run them!
Run!
Keep running!
Run as if the devil himself and itself is upon us!
Do we have a heading?
Argh!
Run!
Land.
Which port?
I didn't say "port," I said "land."
Any land.
Jack's hat!
Bring her about!
No, no!
Leave it!
Run.
Back to your stations, the lot of you!
Jack?
Shh.
For the love of mother and child, Jack, what's coming after us?
Nothing.
Here, now, you can't be here.
I think you'll find he can.
Mr. Swann!
Governor Swann, still.
Do you think I wear this wig to keep my head warm?
Jack's compass?
What does Beckett want with that?
Does it matter?
I'm to find Jack and convince him to return to Port Royal.
In exchange, the charges against us will be dropped.
No.
We must find our own avenue to secure your freedom.
Is that a lack of faith in Jack or in me?
That you would risk your life to save Sparrow does not mean he would do the same for anyone else.
Now, where is that dog with the keys?
I have faith in you.
Both of you.
Where will you find him?
Tortuga.
I'll start there and I won't stop searching till I find him.
And then I intend to return here to marry you.
Properly?
Eagerly, if you'll still have me.
If it weren't for these bars, I'd have you already.
I'll wait for you.
Keep a weather eye on the horizon.
Captain Jack Sparrow?
Owes me four doubloons.
Heard he was dead.
Singapore.
That's what I heard.
Drunk, with a smile on his face.
Sure as the tide, Jack Sparrow turn up in Singapore.
Jack Sparrow?
I haven't seen him in a month.
When you find him, will you give him a message?
Can't say about Jack Sparrow, but there's an island just south of the straits where I trade spice for... mm, delicious long pork.
Cannot say about Jack, but you'll find a ship there.
A ship with black sails.
My brother will take you ashore.
What's wrong?
The beach is there.
C'est trop dangereux.
What?
C'est trop dangereux.
je vous l'avais dit.
Bon voyage.
monsieur.
Jack!
Jack Sparrow!
Marty!
Cotton!
Anybody?
Ah.
A familiar face.
Don't eat me.
I'm not going to eat you.
Don't eat me.
No.
Don't eat me.
Gibbs.
Come on!
Let's go!
Come on!
Who wants it?
I can do this all day!
Jack?
Jack Sparrow!
I can honestly say I'm glad to see you.
Jack, it's me.
Will Turner.
Tell them to let me down!
...eensy-weensy.
...eunuchy.
Snip, snip.
Eunuchy.
Jack, the compass.
That's all I need.
Elizabeth is in danger.
We were arrested for helping you.
She faces the gallows!
Savvy?
Save me.
Jack, what did you tell them?
No!
What about Elizabeth?
Jack!
That's a good girl.
Come a little closer.
We don't bite.
Go on.
We won't bite you.
Come quickly.
Tell me what's happening.
Our name still has some standing.
I've arranged passage to England.
The captain is a friend of mine.
No!
Will's gone to find Jack!
We cannot count on William Turner.
Come!
He's better than you give him credit for.
This is no time for innocence.
Beckett has offered one pardon only one, and that is promised to Jack Sparrow.
Even if Will succeeds, do not ask me to endure the sight of my daughter walking to the gallows.
Do not.
Perhaps I can ensure a fair trial for Will if he returns.
A fair trial for Will ends in a hanging.
Then there is nothing left for you here.
Whoa!
Wait inside.
Captain?
Captain.
Evening, Governor.
Shame, that.
He was carrying this.
It's a letter to the king.
It's from you.
No... Elizabeth.
What are you doing?
Where is she?
Who?
No doubt you've discovered that loyalty is no longer the currency of the realm, as your father believes.
Then what is?
I'm afraid currency is the currency of the realm.
I expect, then, we can come to some sort of understanding.
I'm here to negotiate.
I'm listening.
I'm listening intently.
These letters of marque are signed by the king.
Yes, and they're not valid until they bear my signature and my seal.
Or else I would not still be here.
You sent Will to get you the compass owned by Jack Sparrow.
It will do you no good.
Do explain.
I have been to the Isla de Muerta.
I have seen the treasure myself.
There is something you need to know.
Ah, I see.
You think the compass leads only to the Isla de Muerta and so you hope to save me from an evil fate.
But you mustn't worry.
I care not for cursed Aztec gold.
My desires are not so provincial.
There's more than one chest of value in these waters.
So perhaps you may wish to enhance your offer.
Consider into your calculations that you robbed me of my wedding night.
So I did.
A marriage interrupted... or fate intervenes?
You're making great efforts to ensure Jack Sparrow's freedom.
These aren't going to Jack.
Oh, really?
To ensure Mr. Turner's freedom, then, I'll still want that compass.
Consider that in your calculations.
I say it was Divine Providence what escaped us from jail.
And I say it was me being clever.
Ain't that right, poochie?
Well, how'd you know it weren't Divine Providence what inspired you to be clever?
Anyways, I ain't stealing no ship.
It ain't stealing.
It's salvaging.
And since when did you care?
Since we're not immortal no more.
We gotta take care of our immortal souls.
You know you can't read.
It's the Bible.
You get credit for trying.
Pretending to read the Bible's a lie.
That's a mark against... Look.
There it is.
What's got into him?
Must have seen a catfish.
Stupid mongrel!
Argh!
Come on!
It's ours for the taking.
Tide's coming in.
That should help.
And salvaging is saving, in a manner of speaking.
There's the truth of it!
Suppose we better save it as soon as we can, what with our souls in such a vulnerable state and all.
Amen to that.
Thank you.
Why would he do this to us?
If Jack is the chief... Aye, the Pelegostos made Jack their chief, but he only remains chief as long as he acts like a chief.
So he had no choice.
He's a captive as much as the rest of us.
Worse, as it turns out.
See, the Pelegostos believe that Jack is a god in human form, and they intend to do him the honor of releasing him from his fleshy prison.
They'll roast him and eat him.
Where's the rest of the crew?
These cages we're in weren't built till after we got here.
The feast is about to begin.
Jack's life will end when the drums stop.
Well, we can't just sit here and wait, then, can we?
No, no.
Oi!
No, no.
More wood.
Big fire.
Big fire.
I am Chief.
Want big fire.
Come on.
Oi.
Tout de suite.
Come on.
More wood.
Whoa!
Oh, bugger.
A little seasoning, eh?
Well done.
Put your legs through.
Start to climb!
Come on, men!
It'll take all of us to crew the Black Pearl!
Actually, you wouldn't need everyone.
About six would do.
Oh, dear.
Hurry!
Come on!
Come on!
Is that all you got?
Wait.
Stop.
Eh?
Stop.
Shh.
Shh.
What are they doing?
Stop.
Snake!
Move!
Well, go on, go get them.
No, no.
Oi!
No, no!
Not good.
Cut it loose!
Find a rock!
Roll the cage!
Come on!
Lift the cage!
Hurry!
Come on, lads.
Lift it like a lady's skirt.
Run!
This way, lads!
Take cover!
Stop it!
Bugger.
Haul loose the mooring line!
The mooring line!
Thief!
Little hairy thief!
Give it back!
Don't bite it!
Haul loose the mooring line!
He's got me eye.
He won't give it back.
How'd you get it back last time?
Excellent!
Our work's half done.
We done it for you, knowing you'd be coming back.
Make ready to sail, boys!
What about Jack?
I won't leave without him.
Oi!
Time to go.
Cast off those lines!
Aaargh!
Make ready to cast off!
Oi!
Good doggy.
Alas, my children, this is the day you shall always remember as the day you almost... Captain Jack Sparrow.
Let's get away from this island and head out to open sea.
Yes to the first.
Yes to the second, but only insofar as we keep to the shallows.
That seems a bit contradictory, Captain.
I have faith in your reconciliatory navigational skills.
Now, where is that monkey?
I want to shoot something.
Jack.
Elizabeth is in danger.
Have you considered just locking her up somewhere?
She is locked up, bound to hang for helping you.
There comes a time when one must take responsibility for one's mistakes.
I need that compass of yours, Jack.
I must trade it for her freedom.
Mr. Gibbs.
Captain.
We have a need to travel upriver.
By need, do you mean a trifling need?
Fleeting?
As in, say, a passing fancy?
No, a resolute and unyielding need.
What we need to do is make sail for Port Royal with all haste.
William, I shall trade you the compass if you will help me to find this.
You want me to find this?
No.
You want you to find this, because the finding of this finds you incapacitorially finding and/or locating in your discovering a way to save your dolly belle, ol' what's-her-face.
Savvy?
This is going to save Elizabeth?
How much do you know about Davy Jones?
Not much.
Yeah, it's going to save Elizabeth.
What's all this?
If you both fancy the dress, you'll just have to share and wear it one after the other.
It's not like that, sir.
This ship is haunted.
Is it, now?
And you?
There's a female presence amongst us here, sir.
All the men, they can feel it.
It's the ghost of a lady widowed before her marriage, I figure it, searching for her husband, lost at sea.
A virgin too, likely as not.
And that bodes ill by all accounts.
I say that we throw the dress overboard and we hope the spirit follows it.
No!
That will just anger the spirit, sir.
What we need to do is find out what the spirit needs, and then get it back to her.
Enough!
Enough!
You're a pair of superstitious goats and it's got the best of you.
Now, this appears to be no more as we have a stowaway on board.
A young woman, by the look of it.
I want you to search the ship and find her.
Oh, and, er... she's probably naked.
Why is Jack afraid of the open ocean?
Well, if you believe such things, there's a beast does the bidding of Davy Jones a fearsome creature with giant tentacles that'll suction your face clean off and drag an entire ship down to the crushing darkness.
The kraken.
They say the stench of its breath is like...
Imagine, the last thing you know on God's green earth is the roar of the kraken and the reeking odor of a thousand rotting corpses.
If you believe such things.
And the key will spare him that?
Well, that's the very question Jack wants answered.
Bad enough even to go visit... her.
Her?
Aye.
No worries, mates.
Tia Dalma and I go way back.
Thick as thieves.
Nigh inseparable, we are.
Were.
Have been.
Before.
I'll watch your back.
It's me front I'm worried about.
Mind the boat.
Mind the boat.
Mind the boat.
Mind the boat.
Mind the boat.
Mind the boat.
Jack Sparrow.
Tia Dalma.
I always knew the wind was going to blow you back to me one day.
You... You have a touch of... destiny about you, William Turner.
You know me?
You want to know me.
There'll be no knowing here.
We've come for help and we're not leaving without it.
I thought I knew you.
Not so well as I had hoped.
Come.
Come.
What service may I do you?
You know I demand payment.
I brought payment.
Look.
An undead monkey.
Top that.
Don't!
You've no idea how long it took us to catch that.
The payment is fair.
We're looking for this.
And what it goes to.
The compass you bartered from me, it cannot lead you to this?
Maybe.
Why?
I hear you.
Jack Sparrow does not know what he wants.
Or do you know, but are loath to claim it as your own?
Your key go to a chest.
And it is what lay inside the chest you seek, don't it?
What is inside?
Gold?
Jewels?
Unclaimed properties of a valuable nature?
Nothing bad, I hope?
You know of Davy Jones, yes?
A man of the sea.
A great sailor, until he run afoul of that which vex all men.
What vexes all men?
What indeed?
The sea.
Sums.
The dichotomy of good and evil.
A woman.
A woman.
He fell in love.
No, no, no, no.
I heard it was the sea he fell in love with.
Same story, different versions, and all are true.
See, it was a woman as changing and harsh and untamable as the sea.
Him never stopped loving her.
But the pain it cause him was too much to live with but not enough to cause him to die.
What exactly did he put into the chest?
Him heart.
Literally or figuratively?
He couldn't literally put his heart in a chest.
Could he?
It was not worth feeling what small, fleeting joy life brings.
And so... him carve out him heart, lock it away in a chest and hide the chest from the world.
The key he keep with him at all times.
You knew this.
I did not.
I didn't know where the key was.
But now we do.
All that's left is to climb aboard the Flying Dutchman, grab the key, you go back to Port Royal and save your bonnie lass, eh?
Let me see your hand.
The black spot!
The black spot!
Black spot!
My eyesight's as good as ever, just so you know.
I have just the thing.
Now, where did I put it?
My little beauty, where are you?
Such a long time in such a mess.
Davy Jones cannot make port.
Cannot step on land but once every ten years.
Land is where you are safe, Jack Sparrow, and so you will carry land with you.
Dirt.
This is a jar of dirt.
Yes.
Is the jar of dirt going to help?
If you don't want it, give it back.
No.
Then it helps.
It seems we have a need to find the Flying Dutchman.
A touch of destiny.
That's the Flying Dutchman?
She doesn't look like much.
Neither do you.
Do not underestimate her.
Must have run afoul of the reef.
So, what's your plan, then?
I row over, search the ship until I find your bloody key.
And if there are crewmen?
I cut down anyone in my path.
I like it.
Simple, easy to remember.
Your chariot awaits you, Sire.
Oi!
If you do happen to get captured, just say Jack Sparrow sent you to settle his debt.
It might save your life.
Bon voyage!
Douse the lamps.
Sailor.
Hoisting the jib, Captain's orders.
Sailor!
Hoisting the jib.
Bring up with a round turn.
There's no use.
You've run aground.
No.
Beneath us.
Foul breath.
Hey!
Hey!
Down on your marrowbones and pray.
Get back!
Get back!
Five men still alive.
The rest have moved on.
Do you fear death?
Do you fear that dark abyss?
All your deeds laid bare.
All your sins punished.
I can offer you an escape.
Don't listen to him!
Do you not fear death?
I'll take my chances, sir.
To the depths.
Cruel blackguard!
Life is cruel.
Why should the afterlife be any different?
I offer you a choice.
Join my crew and postpone the judgment.
One hundred years before the mast.
Will ye serve?
I-I will serve.
There.
You are neither dead nor dying.
What is your purpose here?
Jack Sparrow sent me to settle his debt.
What is your purpose here?
Jack Sparrow sent me to settle his debt.
Did he, now?
I'm sorely tempted to accept that offer.
Oh.
You have a debt to pay.
You've been captain of the Black Pearl for 13 years.
That was our agreement.
Technically I was only captain for two years, then I was mutinied upon.
Then you were a poor captain, but a captain nonetheless.
Have you not introduced yourself all these years as Captain Jack Sparrow?
You have my payment.
One soul to serve on your ship.
One soul is not equal to another.
Aha!
We've established my proposal is sound in principle.
Now we're haggling over price.
Price?
Just how many souls do you think my soul is worth?
One hundred souls.
Three days.
You're a diamond, mate.
Send me back the boy.
I'll get started right off.
I keep the boy.
A good-faith payment.
That leaves you only 99 more to go.
Have you not met Will Turner?
He's noble, heroic, a terrific soprano.
Worth at least four.
Maybe three and a half.
And did I happen to mention... he's in love?
With a girl.
Due to be married.
Betrothed.
Dividing him from her and her from him would only be half as cruel as actually allowing them to be joined in holy matrimony.
Eh?
I keep the boy.
99 souls.
But I wonder, Sparrow, can you live with this?
Can you condemn an innocent man, a friend, to a lifetime of servitude in your name while you roam free?
Yep.
I'm good with it.
Shall we seal it in blood?
I mean... ink.
Three days.
Three days.
- Er, Mr. Gibbs.
Aye.
I-I feel sullied and unusual.
And how do you intend to harvest these 99 souls in three days?
Fortunately, he was mum as to the condition in which these souls need be.
Ah.
Tortuga.
Tortuga.
It's an outrage.
Port tariffs, berthing fees, wharf handling and, heaven help us, pilotage.
Are we all to work for the East India Trading Company, then?
I'm afraid, sir, Tortuga is the only free port left in these waters.
A pirate port is what you mean.
Well, I'm sorry.
An honest sailor is what I am.
I make my living fair and I sleep well each night.
S-sir!
She wants you to do something.
She's trying to give a sign.
Whoa!
Over there!
Look for a sign!
Look, there!
There it is!
There's the sign!
That's seaweed.
Seaweed can be a sign.
Looks like entrails.
That would be a bad sign.
What's that over there?
And what makes you think you're worthy to crew the Black Pearl?
I've never sailed a day in me life.
I figure I should get out, see the world while I'm still young.
You'll do.
Make your mark.
Next!
My wife ran off with my dog and I'm drunk for a month and I don't give an ass rat's if I live or die.
Perfect.
Next!
I know what I want.
I know what I want... Me have one arm and a bum leg.
It's the crow's nest for you.
I know what I want.
Next!
Ever since I was a little lad, I've always wanted to sail the seas... forever.
Sooner than you think.
Sign the roster.
Thanks very much.
How we going?
Including those four, that gives us... four.
And what's your story?
My story.
It's exactly the same as your story, just one chapter behind.
I chased a man across the seven seas.
The pursuit cost me my crew, my commission, and my life.
Commodore?
No, not anymore.
Weren't you listening?
I nearly had you all off Tripoli.
I would have, if not for the hurricane.
Lord.
You didn't try to sail through it?
So, do I make your crew or not?
You haven't said where you're going.
Somewhere nice?!
So, am I worthy to serve under Captain Jack Sparrow?
Or should I just kill you now?
You're hired.
Sorry.
Old habits and all that.
Easy, sailor!
That's our captain you're threatening.
Time to go.
Aye!
Thanks, mate.
Aargh!
Carry on.
Come on, then!
Who wants some?
Form an orderly line and I'll have you all, one by one.
Come on, who's first?
I just wanted the pleasure of doing that myself.
James Norrington.
What has the world done to you?
Heave!
Heave!
Heave!
Heave!
Heave!
Heave!
Secure the mast tackle, Mr. Turner!
Set to it!
Step aside.
Hey!
Mind yourself!
Let go, boy!
No.
Haul that weevil to his feet.
Five lashes will remind you to stay on 'em!
No!
Impeding me in my duties?
You'll share the punishment.
I'll take it all.
Will you, now?
And what would prompt such an act of charity?
My son.
He's my son.
What fortuitous circumstance be this?
Five lashes be owed, I believe it is.
No.
No, I won't!
The cat's out of the bag, Mr. Turner.
Your issue will feel its sting, be it by the bosun's hand or your own.
No.
Bosun!
No!
You had it easy, boy!
Will.
I don't need your help.
The bosun prides himself on cleaving flesh from bone, with every swing.
So I'm to understand what you did was an act of compassion?
Yes.
100 years before the mast, losing who you were, bit by bit, until you end up... end up like poor Wyvern here.
Once you've sworn an oath to the Dutchman, there's no leaving it.
Not until your debt is paid.
I've sworn no oath.
You must get away.
Not until I find this.
The key.
The dead man's chest.
What do you know of this?
Open the chest with the key, and stab the heart... No, don't stab the heart.
The Dutchman needs a living heart or there'll be no captain, and if there's no captain, there's no one to have the key.
So the captain has the key?
Where is the key?
Hidden.
Where is the chest?
Hidden.
Captain Sparrow!
Come to join me crew, lad?
Welcome aboard.
I'm here to find the man I love.
I'm deeply flattered, son, but my first and only love is the sea.
Meaning William Turner, Captain Sparrow.
Elizabeth.
Hide the rum.
These clothes do not flatter you.
It should be a dress or nothing.
I happen to have no dress in my cabin.
Jack.
I know Will came to find you.
Where is he?
Darling, I am truly unhappy to have to tell you this, but... through unfortunate circumstances that had nothing whatsoever to do with me, poor Will has been press-ganged into Davy Jones's crew.
Davy Jones?
Oh, please.
The captain of the Flying Dutchman?
You look awful.
What are you doing here?
You hired me.
I can't help it if your standards are lax.
You smell funny.
Jack!
All I want is to find Will.
Are you certain?
Is that what you really want most?
Of course.
Because I would think you'd want to find a way to save Will most.
And you'd have a way of doing that?
Well... there is a chest.
Oh, dear.
A chest of unknown size and origin.
What contains the still-beating heart of Davy Jones.
And whoever possesses that chest possesses the leverage to command Jones to do whatever it is he or she wants, including saving brave William from his grim fate.
You don't actually believe him, do you?
How would we find it?
With this.
My compass... is unique.
"Unique" here having the meaning of "broken."
True enough, this compass does not point north.
Where does it point?
It points to the thing you want most in this world.
Oh, Jack.
Are you telling the truth?
Every word, love.
And what you want most in this world is to find the chest of Davy Jones, is it not?
To save Will.
By finding the chest of Davy Jones.
Mr. Gibbs!
Cap'n.
We have our heading.
Finally!
Cast off those lines.
Weigh anchor and crowd that canvas!
Miss Swann.
Welcome to the crew, former commodore.
There's something to knowing the exact shape of the world and one's place in it.
I assure you, these are not necessary.
I thought you'd be interested in the whereabouts of your daughter.
You have news of her?
Most recently seen on Tortuga, and then left in the company of a known pirate, Jack Sparrow, and other fugitives from justice.
"Justice"?
Hardly.
Including the previous owner of this sword, I believe.
Our ships are in pursuit.
Justice will be dispensed by cannonade and cutlass, and all manner of remorseless pieces of metal.
I find it distasteful to even contemplate the horror facing all those on board.
What do you want from me?
Your authority as governor, your influence in London, and your loyalty to the East India Trading Company.
To you, you mean.
Shall I remove these shackles?
Do what you can for my daughter.
So you see, Mercer, every man has a price he will willingly accept.
Even for what he hoped never to sell.
I wager... ten years.
I'll match ten years.
Agreed.
Wondering how it's played?
I understand.
Liar!
It's a game of deception.
But your bet includes all the dice, not just your own.
What are they wagering?
Oh, the only thing we have.
Years of service.
So any crew member can be challenged?
Aye.
Anyone.
I challenge Davy Jones.
I accept, mate.
The stakes?
My soul.
An eternity of servitude.
No!
Against?
I want this.
How do you know of the key?
That's not part of the game, is it?
You can still walk away.
What's this?
I'm in.
Matching his wager.
No!
Don't do this.
The die is cast.
I bid three twos.
It's your bid, Captain.
Four fours.
Four fives.
Six threes.
Seven fives.
Eight fives.
Welcome to the crew, lad.
Twelve fives.
Twelve fives.
Call me a liar, or up the bid.
And be called a liar myself for my trouble?
Bootstrap Bill, you're a liar and you will spend an eternity on this ship.
Master Turner, feel free to go ashore... the very next time we make port!
Fool.
Why did you do that?
I couldn't let you lose.
It was never about winning or losing.
The key.
You just wanted to know where it was.
Captain says I'm to relieve you.
Captain's orders.
Here.
Take this, too.
Now, get yourself to land, and stay there.
It was always in my blood to die at sea.
It was not a fate I ever wanted for you.
It's not a fate you had to choose for yourself, either.
Aye.
I could say I did what I had to, when I left you to go pirating.
But it would taste a lie to say it wasn't what I wanted.
You owe me nothing, Will.
Now go.
They'll know you helped me.
What more can they do to me?
I take this with a promise.
I'll find a way to sever Jones's hold on you, and not rest until this blade pierces his heart.
I will not abandon you.
I promise.
Beckett?
Yes, they're signed.
Lord Cutler Beckett of the East India Trading Company.
Bluergh!
Will was working for Beckett and never said a word.
Beckett wants the compass.
Only one reason for that.
Of course.
He wants the chest.
Yes, he did say something about a chest.
If the company controls the chest, they controls the sea.
A truly discomfiting notion, love.
And bad.
Bad for every mother's son what calls himself a pirate.
I think there's a bit more speed to be coaxed from these sails.
Brace the foreyard!
Might I enquire as to how you came by these?
Persuasion.
Friendly?
Decidedly not.
Will strikes a deal, yet you were the one with the prize full pardon.
"Commission as a privateer on behalf of England "and the East India Trading Company."
As if I could be bought for such a low price.
Jack, the letters, give them back.
No.
Persuade me.
You do know Will taught me how to handle a sword?
As I said, persuade me.
It's a curious thing.
There was a time I would have wanted you to look like that while thinking about me.
I don't know what you mean.
I think you do.
Oh, don't be absurd.
I trust him, that's all.
So you never wondered how your latest fianc ended up on the Flying Dutchman in the first place?
Strange to come upon a longboat so far out in open water.
Just put as many leagues behind us as you can.
As fast as you can.
And what are we running from?
That dress.
Where did you get it?
It was found aboard the ship.
The crew thought it was a spirit bringing some omen of ill-fate.
That's foolish.
Oh, yes.
Exceedingly foolish.
It brought good fortune.
The spirit told us, "Pull in at Tortuga," and we made a nice bit of profit there.
Off the books, of course.
I imagine some of your crew may have jumped ship there.
Why do you ask?
Captain!
A ship's been spotted.
Colors?
She isn't flying any.
Pirates.
Or worse.
You will watch this.
Aagh!
Let no joyful voice be heard!
Let no man look up at the sky with hope.
Aargh!
And let this day be cursed by we who ready to wake... the kraken.
No!
I've doomed us all.
It's the Flying Dutchman!
Oh, Mother Carey's chickens!
What happened?
Must have hit a reef.
Free the rudder!
Hard to port then hard to starboard.
Free the rudder!
Hard to port!
Kraken!
Kraken!
Here it is!
Take it!
Take it!
Aargh!
Agh!
Aaaagh!
Aagh!
Aaagh!
The boy's not here.
He must have been claimed by the sea.
I am the sea.
You need time alone with your thoughts.
Brig!
What of the survivors?
There are no survivors.
The chest is no longer safe.
Chart a course to Isla Cruces.
Get me there first, or there'll be the devil to pay.
"First"?
Who sent that thieving charlatan onto my ship?
Who told him of the key?
Jack Sparrow.
My intuitive sense of the female creature informs me that you are troubled.
I just thought I'd be married by now.
I'm so ready to be married.
You know... Lizzie, I am captain of a ship, and being captain of a ship, I could in fact perform a "marr-i-age" right here.
Right on this deck.
Right... now.
No, thank you.
Why not?
We are very much alike, you and I. I and you.
Us.
Oh.
Except for a sense of honor and decency and a moral center.
And personal hygiene.
Trifles.
You will come over to my side.
I know it.
You seem very certain.
One word, love.
Curiosity.
You long for freedom.
You long to do what you want to do because you want it.
To act on selfish impulse.
You want to see what it's like.
One day, you won't be able to resist.
Why doesn't your compass work?
My compass works fine.
Because you and I are alike, and there will come a moment when you have a chance to show it.
To do the right thing.
I love those moments.
I like to wave at them as they pass by.
You'll have the chance to do something... something courageous.
And when you do, you'll discover something.
That you're a good man.
All evidence to the contrary.
Oh, I have faith in you.
Want to know why?
Do tell, dearie.
Curiosity.
You're going to want it.
A chance to be admired and gain the rewards that follow.
You won't be able to resist.
You're going to want to know what it tastes like.
I do want to know what it tastes like.
But... seeing as you're a good man, I know that you'd never put me in a position that would compromise my honor.
I'm proud of you, Jack.
Land, ho!
I want my jar of dirt.
You're pulling too fast.
You're pulling too slow.
We don't want the kraken to catch us.
I'm saving me strength for when it comes.
And I don't think it's "kracken" anyways.
I always heard it said "krayken."
With a long a?
Uh-huh.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
"Krocken" is how it's pronounced in Scandinavian, and "kracken" is closer to that.
We ain't Scandinavians, are we?
"Krayken."
It's a mythological creature.
I can calls it what I wants.
Guard the boat.
Mind the tide.
Don't touch my dirt.
This doesn't work.
And it certainly doesn't show you what you want most.
Yes, it does.
You're sitting on it.
Beg pardon?
Move.
"Guard the boat!"
"Mind the tide!"
I could join the circus.
Mind if I shine your shoes, sir?
They're here.
And I cannot step foot on land again for near of a decade.
You'll trust us to act in your stead?
I'll trust you to know what awaits you should you fail!
Down, then!
Down!
It's real.
You actually were telling the truth.
I do that quite a lot, yet people are always surprised.
With good reason!
Will!
You're all right!
Thank God!
I came to find you!
How did you get here?
Sea turtles, mate.
A pair of them, strapped to my feet.
Not so easy, is it?
But I do owe you thanks, Jack.
You do?
After you tricked me onto that ship to square your debt with Jones... What?
What?
...I was reunited with my father.
Oh, well... you're welcome, then.
Everything you said to me, every word was a lie!
Pretty much.
Time and tide, love.
Oi!
What are you doing?
I'm going to kill Jones.
Can't let you do that, William.
'Cause if Jones is dead, who's to call his terrible beastie off the hunt, eh?
Now, if you please.
The key.
I keep the promises I make, Jack.
I intend to free my father.
I hope you're here to see it.
I can't let you do that either.
So sorry.
I knew you'd warm up to me eventually.
Lord Beckett desires the content of that chest.
I deliver it, I get my life back.
Ah.
The dark side of ambition.
Oh, I prefer to see it as the promise of redemption.
Aagh!
Stop it!
Hyah!
Will!
Guard the chest!
No!
This is barbaric!
This is no way for grown men to... Oh, fine!
Let's just haul out our swords and start banging away at each other.
That will solve everything!
I've had it!
I've had it with wobbly-legged, rum-soaked pirates!
How'd this go all screwy?
Well, each wants the chest for hisself.
Mr. Norrington, I think, is trying to regain a bit of honor, old Jack's looking to trade it, save his own skin, then Turner, there, I think he's trying to settle some unresolved business 'twixt him and his twice-cursed pirate father.
Sad.
This is madness!
That chest must be worth more than a shiny penny.
Terrible temptation.
If we was any kind of decent, we'd remove temptation from their path.
Enough!
Oh.
Oh!
The heat!
Bugger!
By your leave, Mr. Turner.
By your leave, Mr. Norrington.
Do excuse me while I kill the man who ruined my life.
Be my guest.
Let us examine that claim for a moment.
Who was it, that at the very moment you had a notorious pirate safely behind bars, saw fit to free said pirate and take your dearly beloved all to hisself?
Eh?
So whose fault is it, really, that you've ended up a rum-pot deckhand what takes orders from pirates?
Enough!
Unfortunately, Mr. Turner, he's right!
Still rooting for you, mate.
Oh!
Oof!
Aargh!
We got it!
We got it!
We got it!
Hello, poppet.
Come on, run!
Sword!
Sword!
Sword!
Sword!
Aargh!
Ugh!
Follow my voice.
Follow my voice.
To the left... no, turn around.
Go to the right.
No, that's a tree.
Oh, shut it.
Jar of dirt!
Argh!
Right.
We've got it!
Come on, Turner!
Leave him lie!
Unless you plan on using him to hit something with.
We're not getting out of this.
Not with the chest.
Into the boat.
You're mad!
Don't wait for me.
I say we respect his final wish.
Aye!
Your bravery is wasted.
I shall pry the chest away from your cold, dead hands.
Here you go!
Oof!
Pirates!
Hey!
What happened to the chest?
Norrington took it to draw them off.
You're pulling too hard!
You ain't pulling hard enough!
Where's the commodore?
Fell behind.
My prayers be with him.
Best not wallow in our grief.
The bright side is you're back, and made it off free and clear.
Lord on high, deliver us.
I'll handle this, mate.
Oi, fishface!
Lose something?
Eh?
Scungilli!
Got it!
Come to negotiate, eh, have you, you slimy git?
Look what I got.
# I got a jar of dirt, I got a jar of dirt # And guess what's inside it?
Enough!
Hard to starboard.
Hard to starboard!
Brace up the foreyard!
Hard to starboard!
Send his beloved Pearl back to the depths.
She's on us!
She's on us!
Let them taste the triple guns.
Aye, Captain.
Aaargh!
Make fast!
Go on, me darling!
Show us what you've got!
Come on, girl!
She's falling behind!
Aye.
We've got her!
We're the faster?
Against the wind, the Dutchman beats us.
But with the wind... We rob her advantage.
Aye.
We're out of range!
Break off pursuit, run her light and douse canvas!
We're giving up, sir?
Agh!
They're giving up!
My father is on that ship.
We can take her.
We should turn and fight.
Why fight when you can negotiate?
All one needs is the proper leverage.
Oh!
Where is it?
Where is the thump-thump?
We must have hit a reef!
No.
It's not a reef!
Get away from the rail!
What is it?
The kraken.
To arms!
Load guns!
Defend the mast!
It'll attack the starboard.
Run out the cannons and hold for my signal!
Easy, boys!
Will?
Steady!
Steady.
Will!
Hold.
Hold.
I think we've held fire long enough.
Will!
Fire!
Oh!
It'll be back.
We have to get off the ship.
There's no boats.
Pull the grates.
Get all the gunpowder onto the net in the cargo hold!
Whatever you do, don't miss.
As soon as you're clear.
We are short-stocked on gunpowder!
Six barrels!
Hurry up!
There's only six kegs of powder!
Then load the rum.
Aye, the rum too!
Step to!
Oh, you coward.
Not good.
Haul away!
Heave!
Heave like you're being paid for it!
Put your backs into it!
Aargh!
I got you!
I got you!
Don't let me go!
I won't let you go!
Shoot me!
Clear?
Higher!
Higher!
Here!
Come on!
Come and get me.
I'm over here!
Come on!
Shoot!
Elizabeth, shoot!
Did we kill it?
No.
We just made it angry.
We're not out of this yet.
Captain, orders!
Abandon ship.
Into the longboat.
Jack.
The Pearl.
She's only a ship, mate.
He's right.
We have to head for land.
It's a lot of open water.
It's a lot of water.
We have to try.
We can get away as it takes down the Pearl.
Abandon ship.
Abandon ship or abandon hope.
Thank you, Jack.
We're not free yet, love.
You came back.
I always knew you were a good man.
Prepare to cast off.
There's no time to lose.
Come on, Will.
Step to!
It's after you, not the ship.
It's not us.
This is the only way, don't you see?
I'm not sorry.
Pirate.
Where's Jack?
He elected to stay behind to give us a chance.
Go!
Bugger.
Bugger, bugger, bugger, bugger, bugger!
Come on!
Just got it.
Come on.
Not so bad.
Oh.
Hello, beastie.
Jack Sparrow, our debt is settled.
The captain goes down with his ship.
Turns out not even Jack Sparrow can best the devil.
Open the chest.
Open the chest.
I need to see it!
Damn you, Jack Sparrow!
The last of our ships is returned.
Is there any news on the chest?
None.
But one of the ships did pick up a man adrift at sea.
He had these.
I took the liberty of filling in my name.
If you intend to claim these, then you must have something to trade.
Do you have the compass?
Better.
The heart of Davy Jones.
Against the cold... and the sorrow.
It's a shame.
I know you're thinking that with the Pearl you could have captured the devil and set free your father's soul.
Doesn't matter now.
The Pearl is gone, along with its captain.
Aye.
And already the world seems a bit less bright.
He fooled us all right till the end, but I guess that honest streak finally won out.
To Jack Sparrow.
Never another like Captain Jack.
He was a gentleman of fortune, he was.
He was a good man.
If there was anything could be done to bring him back... Elizabeth.
Would you do it?
Hm?
What would you... Hm?
What would any of you be willing to do, hm?
Would you sail to the ends of the Earth and beyond to fetch back witty Jack and him precious Pearl?
Aye.
Aye.
Aye.
Aye.
Yes.
Aye.
All right.
But if you go and brave the weird and haunted shores at world's end... then you will need a captain who knows those waters.
So tell me, what's become of my ship?
From timings by: Ishlah Captain!
Who are you?
What is this man?
Your Majesty... We caught him up in our fishing nets.
He's been telling stories, stories that... We believe he's found him... Ponce de Len...
He said he found Ponce de Leon's ship.
He sailed on it.
No, I told you... Ponce de Leon died 200 years ago.
Aye, but he died searching for something, didn't he ?
The Fountain of Youth... How soon can you sail ?
With the tide.
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides LONDON ENGLAND Pirates execution today!
Watch him swing.
Hurry papa, or we'll miss the hanging.
It's not a hanging, dear, it's a trial.
The hanging comes this afternoon.
Come on!
On your feet.
Move along, pirate!
Or should I say filthy pirate!
Come on .
Order !
Now appearing before the courts, the notorious and infamous pirate... ...pillager and highwayman, Captain Jack Sparrow!
I told ya.
Me names Gibbs.
Joshamee Gibbs.
How many times do I have to...
Hear Ye, Hear Ye.
Presiding over these trials, all rise and attend... the right Honorable Justice Smith!
Quiet !
Now... What do we have here?
Jack?
Not necessary.
You were saying ?
Jack Sparrow is not my name.
My name is Joshamee Gibbs.
Is that so?
It says Jack Sparrow here.
I told em.
I'm not Jack Sparrow, who I would be happy to identify to the court, if it would help my case.
I think that would be a poor defense.
Unless you want to be bludgeoned again like a harp seal.
Prisoner claiming to be innocent to being Jack Sparrow.
How do you find ?
No trial ?
But aren't we here to examine the evidence?
Foreman, your finding.
Guilty ?
Guilty verdict means he'll hang.
Hang him !
String him up !
Guilty ?
That's not fair!
Shut it!
Joshamee Gibbs.
For the crime of which you've been found guilty of.
Of being innocent of being Jack Sparrow.
I hereby commute your sentence... and order that you be imprisoned for the remainder of your miserable, morible, mutton chop life.
What?
Hang him !
There !
String him up !
Hang him high !
It needs to be arranged to transport this prisoner to the Tower of London!
Thank you very much.
Get up you !
Hell, horse and teeth.
Now we're both headed for prison.
Not to worry.
I've paid off the driver.
Ten minutes we'll be outside London town horses waitin and tonight we'll make the coast.
Then it's just a matter of finding the ship.
All part of a plan, yes ?
Exactly.
I arrived in London town just this morning to rescue one Joshamee... ...Gibbs from one appointment with the gallows.
Seeing as how you're still alive, I'd say it's all been very successful this far.
What happened to you, Gibbs?
I thought you were employed elsewhere or otherwise engaged.
Aye, but I always listen like a thief for news of the Black Pearl.
Nobody see where she might next make port.
Then I hear a rumor.
Jack Sparrow's in London.
With a ship, and lookin for a crew.
Am not.
But that's what I heard.
Fact is, your signing up me ??.
Pub called the Captains Daughter.
Am not!
Well I thought it a bit odd.
But then you've never been the most predictable of sorts.
Tell me something.
There is another Jack Sparrow out there sullying my good name ?
An imposter.
Indeed.
But...an imposter with a ship.
And in need of a crew.
Which as fate would have it, so am I.
How bout you, Jack?
Last I heard you were hellbent to find the Fountain of Youth.
Any luck ?
Circumstances arose and forced compelling insights .. regarding discretion and valor.
Meaning, ye gave up.
I did not!
I'm just as bent as ever.
Hellishly so.
I shall taste those waters first Gibbs.
Mark my words.
Oh.
Short trip.
All part of the plan, yeah ?
No !
You are Jack Sparrow ?
There should be a "Captain" in there somewhere.
I've heard of you.
And you know who I am.
Face is familiar.
Have I threatened you before ?
You are in the presence of George Augustus Duke of Brunswick-Lneburg... Art treasurer and print selector of the Holy Roman Empire... King of Great Britain and Ireland.
And of you.
Doesn't ring a bell.
I am informed you have come to London to procure a crew for your ship.
Vicious rumour.
Not true.
Then you lied to me when you told me you were Jack Sparrow.
I am Jack Sparrow, but I'm not here to procure a crew.
That is...someone else.
Ah...someone else named Jack Sparrow.
You brought me the wrong wastrel.
Find the proper one and dispose of this imposter.
No.
Wait, wait , wait hang on a minute.
I'm Jack Sparrow the one and only.
And I am in London.
To procure a crew ?
To undertake a voyage to find the fountain... What?
Will someone please remove these infernal chains.
Come come!
We know you're in possession of a map.
Confiscate the map and to the gallows with you.
Have you a map?
No.
Where is it?
The truth.
I lost it.
Quite recently in fact.
I have a report the Spanish have located the fountain of youth.
I will not have some melancholy Spanish monarch... ...a Catholic, gain eternal life !
You do know the way to the fountain ?
Course I do.
Look at me !
You can guide an expedition.
With your permission, your highnee.
You will be providing then, a ship.
And a crew.
And a captain.
After you, Sire.
If I may be so bold.
Why is that man not in chains ?
He must be manacled at once.
Center of my palace?
Hardly.
Hector.
How nice to see a fellow pirate make good for himself.
Pirate?
No.
Privateer.
On a sanctioned mission under the authority and protection of the Crown.
As may be, but first...What has become of my beloved Pearl?
I lost the Pearl, as I lost my leg!
Lost the Pearl?
Aye.
I defended her mightily enough.
But she sunk none the less.
If that ship be sunk properly, you should be sunk with it.
Captain Barbossa.
Each second we tarry...
The Spanish out distance us.
I have every confidence you will prevail and... ...be rewarded with the high station you so desire.
To serve doth suffice, Sire.
You, sir, are stupid.
??
.
Where's the harm in joinin the winnin side ?
And we do meet in nicer climes, ??.
I understand everything.
Except that wig.
He escaped ?
Leave it to me, Sire.
Guards!
Find him!
There!
Ah !
Oh !
Oh !
Aah!
Is that it?
Fire!
He's getting away !
Filthy pirate!
Hallo, Jackie!
Hello, Dad.
I heard you're puttin together a crew.
If enough people keep sayin it, it must be true.
I heard where you're headed.
The fountain.
Have you been there?
Does this face look like it's been to the Fountain of Youth?
Depends on the light.
Son, the Fountain...
There'll be items required.
For the profound ritual.
Two chalices.
On the map there was a chalice.
Two silver... From the Ponce de Leon ship.
You'll need both.
For?
The ritual.
Don't be a fool, Jackie.
Find out every detail before you set sail.
Oh, set sail, love to.
But for that I may need a ship.
Those folk over there, they have a ship.
They're signin up sailors, right now.
One last thing, Jackie.
The Fountain will test you.
Mark my words.
I hear you be recruitin a crew.
Aye.
That is... Jack Sparrow be puttin together a modest venture.
You got some nerve, aint ya ?
Turnin up here dressed like that.
What are you, some kind of an impostor ?
Do you have any idea who I am, mate ?
Hey, markers.
There's a bloke here whats forgotten his own name.
Lads, I'm sailing with Sparrow.
Who'll buy a sailor a drink ?
You've stolen me.
And I'm here to take meself back.
Stop doing that.
Only one person alive knows that move.
Always wanted to do that.
Hello Angelica.
Hello, Jack.
Are you impressed.
I think I almost killed you once or twice.
I'm touched at this most sincerest form of flattery.
But why?
You were the only pirate I thought I would pass for.
That is not a compliment.
Don't worry, Jack.
I forgave you a long time ago.
For what ?
For leaving you ?
I recall that I left you !
A gentleman allows a lady to maintain her fiction.
Look Sparrow.
As long as my sailors get their money... ...they're willing to put up with any number of peculiarities.
Ah.
There is one peculiarity with which I will not put up with.
I will be impersonated as Captain.
Nothing less.
For that you need a ship.
And as it turns out...I have one.
I could use a ship.
I hear tell you've been to the fountain.
There's been a lot of hear telling going on these days.
The Fountain of Youth.
Dearest Angelica.
Fret not.
You still have a few usable years left.
Always so charming.
But you didn't answer me.
Eh ?
Have I gone to the fountain ?
Waste of time.
Me lady.
I see un-seamen like fellows with an officious looking nature.
Friends of yours ?
I may have unintentionally slighted some king or other.
You haven't changed !
Implying the need ?
Yes!
You betrayed me.
You seduced me, and you used me.
I was innocent in the ways of men.
You demonstrated a lot of technique for someone I supposedly corrupted.
(pounding on the door) Open this door !
I was ready to take my vows, and you... What were you doing in a Spanish convent anyway ?
I was looking for a brothel.
It was a mistake.
There!
We are at a disadvantage.
Speak for yourself !
Unlike some who pretend to be...
But in fact cannot hold a candle to.
I am Captain Jack Sparrow.
Back then you said I used you... You know exactly how.
I know, but how can you say it?
So, what is it ?
What is what ?
About the fountain.
What do you know ?
You don't happen to be in possession of 2 sliver chalices instead of Ponce de Len ?
No.
Ha!
Thought not.
Why ?
I hear stories, rumors... You are of course aware of the ritual.
Yes, I am.
What is it ?
What is required ?
A Mermaid, Jack.
You made a mistake!
It's a life sentence, not death!
Life !
Barbossa !
Thank you gentlemen.
I trust you can tie a noose.
It's a hard thing.
Forcing a man to twist his own hangin rope.
You must lie in the bed the way you made it.
What's happened to you?
Where be Jack Sparrow?
He escaped.
I'm on a tight schedule Gibbs.
The HMS Providence sets sail at first light.
If you didn't care to watch it hanging here dead, with a mouth full of flies...
Speak now.
Take me with you.
Any point of the compass.
Take you where, Gibbs?
The Fountain ?
Aye ?
Is that where Jack be headed ?
Have ya anything you can offer me, Gibbs?
Anything at all ?
Upon my naked word, you'll not see the dawn.
Hand it over.
You fool !
I had just enough time to study those infernal circles, Every route.
Every destination.
All safe.
In here.
Welcome back to his majesties Navy Master Gibbs.
Show a leg, sailor!
Aye, sir!
What?
There's been a horrible mistake.
Keep moving.
I'm not supposed to be here.
Many a mans woken up at sea... ...no idea what, when, wherefore or why.
No memory of the night before.
Once he signed up and drank away all his bonus money.
No, no, no.
You don't understand, mate.
I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.
The original.
The only.
I'm Scrum and the pleasure's all mine.
Now keep moving.
Scrum.
Why is there a glass coffin ?
Do I look like a man in charge ?
Where am I?
Excuse me, Captain Sparrow sir.
I'll be right honored to welcome you aboard a well renowned vessel of infamy.
Queen Anne's Revenge.
Blackbeard.
He's a curious one.
He's been zombified.
Eh?
Zombified.
Blackbeards doing.
All the officers are the same.
Makes em more compliant.
And perpetually ill tempered.
Come on, scrub.
Yes.
Pull !
Pull!
Five days underway, at least.
Aye.
You can tell that by the smell of the sea ?
Smell of the crew !
Oy.
What does that poor sop do ?
How can I make sure to not ?
Him?
Churchly fellow.
Always goin on about the lord almighty.
Bible thumper on this ship?
A missionaries his story.
What I heard was he got captured in a raid.
Rest of the ship got killed.
But not him.
First mate wouldn't let it happen, on account of his premier standing with the lord.
First mate, stickin her neck out, for some prisoner.
That, you don't see.
Her ?
First mate is a her ?
Back to work !
Steady as she goes.
You are a ruthless, soulless, cross-grained cur.
I told you I had a ship.
No, Blackbeard has a ship.
Upon which I am now imprisoned.
We can do this, Jack.
The Fountain of Youth... Like you always wanted.
Blackbeard.
Edward Teach.
The pirate all pirates fear.
Resurrector of the dead in his spare time.
He will listen to me.
He listens to no one.
Maybe to his own daughter.
His daughter as in, begat by ?
Long lost, recently found... ...who loves her dear papa with all her soul.
He bought that ?
I sold that !
Then this is the fountain of youth for him.
Or, I mean you.
Not you and me.
No, Jack, that's the best part.
He will be dead.
Ahh.
You'll be handling that part yourself then ?
There is a prophecy.
Maybe you don't believe in the supernatural.
Oh no, no, no.
I've seen a thing or two.
The prophecy is this: Blackbeard will meet his death... ...within a fortnight.
At the hands of a one legged man.
That's why he needs the Fountain, Jack.
Ah, Master Gibbs, storer of the map.
Perhaps you'd be so kind as to provide us a heading.
Dear Jim, pour me a gobbler.
Hey.
We be privateers, not pirates Master Gibbs.
And in the kings name, we behave as such.
Aye, Captain.
Be we on the proper course, Gibbs?
Aye, it be proper.
There's your proof.
A Spaniard.
All hands, battle stations.
Turn windward.
Move the cannons!
Gunners take balls.
Await orders.
Ready !
Guns armed, awaiting orders sir.
Sir, orders ?
Sir ?
Never so much as turned his head.
The fountain is the prize.
It appears we be not even worth the time it would take to sink us.
And now we've fallen behind.
All hands make more sail.
All hands more sail !
Weigh hard me wind.
We need a tide.
The topic gentlemen, is mutiny.
Mutiny most foul.
Aye.
I signed up to sail under Jack Sparrow.
Not some pretender.
And a lady at that.
A mention was failed to be made to this uncanny crew.
Made my toes curl, it do.
I got em.
All of them.
Well done !
On to it then.
Blackbeard.
What are his habits ?
Stays most in his cabin.
That's right.
My lady crews cabin.
Yes, but when he comes out.
Don't really come out.
Must come out some time !
Not really, no.
Ain't seen him.
Never.
Any of you sailed with him before ?
No, never.
Any of you seen him before ?
Not really, no.
Stays in his cabin.
No ones sailed with him, seen him.
Good news, gentlemen!
This is not Blackbeard's ship.
This is not the Queen Anne's Revenge.
This be the Queen Anne's Revenge right enough.
How do you know?
I seen the name, on the back of the ship.
Gentlemen, sailors, fellow conscriptees.
You have been monstrously deceived.
We are decepted then !
Yes.
You've nay been informed of the destination.
Death lies before us, as we sail...for the Fountain of Youth.
Might be a sorry fate, mates.
For certain.
Unless.
We take the ship.
We take the ship then.
Now !
Go on then.
Jack...
If this is a dream, you can keep the sword and boots on.
If it's not...
It's a dream !
No it's not.
I thought I should give you fair warning.
We're taking the ship.
(yelling in Spanish ?)
Nothing personal !
Stay out of it.
??
You're either with us or against us!
I'm not with you.
Neither am I against you!
Can he do that ?
He's religious.
I believe it's required.
Fight to the bitter end you cack-headed jackeye ??
Take him men and tie him down tight.
The ship is ours!
Gentlemen.
I be placed in a bewilderment.
There I were...resting... And upon a sudden, I hear an ungodly row on deck.
Sailors abandon their posts without orders and without leave.
Men before the mast.
Taking the ship for themselves.
Would be that mutiny, mate?
Mutiny, Captain!
Again ?
Mutiny !
Aye, mutiny.
And what fate befalls mutineers ?
Now we know the answer to that, do we not.
Mutineers...
Hang !
Captain, I wish to report a mutiny.
I can name fingers and point names.
No need, Mr. Sparrow.
They are sheep, you their shepherd.
Have I mentioned sir, what a lovely daughter you have.
A pitying last sight for a doomed soul.
Forgive me father.
We need him.
If I don't kill a man every now and then, they forget who I am.
Coward !
Hmm ?
They do not forget.
Your crew sees you for the miscreant you are.
A coward, no matter how many you slay.
Twice in one day, I find myself in a bewilderment.
You are not bewildered.
You are afraid.
You do not walk the path of righteousness the way of the light.
No, sir, the truth is it be much simpler than all that.
I'm a bad man.
That too.
I might have to kill you too, catechist No!
All Latin blood, like her mother.
Father, I beg you!
Ah, there I be again.
Forgetting why the missionary is here.
My daughter, fears for my soul, or what's left of it.
You truly wish to save me, my child ?
Every soul can be saved.
Is that true, young clergy ?
Yes.
Though you I see as a bit of a long shot.
Still I pray for every unfortunate soul on this hell-bound vessel.
You disarm me with your faith.
Eight bells.
Which of you unfortunate souls stood watch ?
I did.
I stood watch.
Hmm Hmm.
Gunner ?
You?
Aye.
Aye.
The cook.
Perfect.
Row the long boat.
Bring her about.
Why do you do this?
Mutiny.
Our laws be clear.
Our laws allow the captain to show leniency.
I've given this man a chance to determine his fate.
A gift not afforded to all.
A chance to show the worth of your prayers.
Pray he be delivered from...evil ?
Port speed.
Give that man a chance!
Give yourself a chance!
You know when I feel closest to our maker ?
When I see suffering, pain and anguish.
That's when the true desire of his will is revealed.
And I see it revealed when in times of hardship and tragedy... ...kindness and compassion are shown to those in need.
Perhaps you should pray for him to be unharmed, yeah ?
Please,there's still hope.
Again !
I actually have no interest in the fountain whatsoever, so... ...if your heart is set, you may drop me off anywhere you like.
That'll be all, quarter master.
Your words surround you like fog.
Make you hard to see.
And what of you, the mighty Blackbeard ?
Beheaded, they say.
Still your body swam three times around your ship and climbed back on board.
And here you are, running scared.
Scared ?
To the fountain.
The quarter master sees things before they happen.
He has foreseen my death.
And so the fates have spoken.
The threads of destiny, woven.
You have a ridiculously high regard for fate.
Fate.
And you?
Me?
I'm skeptical of predicting any future which includes me.
It'd be foolish to battle fate.
But I'd be tempted to cheat it.
I will reach the fountain.
You will lead me.
That knife will serve you no better than the mutiny you devised.
Mutiny served me well.
It gained me an audience with you.
Aye.
To warn you.
Regarding your first mate.
Who pretends to be persons she is not.
Do tell.
She is not your daughter.
Yes, she has my flesh and blood Sir.
The woman is consummate in the art of deception.
I know, as I mostly unwittingly, set her on her wicked path.
Though I cannot claim credit for her existing abundance of natural talent.
Angelica.
My beloved daughter.
The one true good thing I've done in this life.
And you claim to be the one who corrupted her?
Sir.
What she is, is pure evil.
More to be feared than a wild beast.
Hungry wild beast, with gnashing teeth.
Vengeful hungry from Hell beast... Father !
Sweetness !
No need to hurt him father.
He will help us.
Won't you, Jack?
You see, even now she tends to your welfare.
Giving lie to the claims you make of her.
You will lead us to the fountain !
Yes ?
Put another way.
If I, do not make it to the fountain in time...
Neither will you.
I'll have a wee look see at those charts right away.
Shall I ?
Sir.
Aye.
Captain, sir.
I am unhappy to report rumors, sir among the crew... ...as to our destination.
Shut your trap and make way.
That's the way of it then ?
No disrespect, sir.
What do the men fear ?
Say it !
Speak the words !
Whitecap Bay.
Aye, Whitecap Bay.
And every worthless seaman fears the name.
And rightly so.
Though few know why or dare to ask.
Be the stories true ?
Say what robs you of your staunch heart, Gibbs, or forever leave it to wilder fears of fantasy.
Mermaids, Captain.
Aye, mermaids.
Sea ghouls.
Devil fish.
Dreadful in hunger for flesh of man.
Mermaid waters.
That we'll pass.
Cling to your soul Gibbs, if mermaids be given to take the rest.
To the bone.
Steady !
Steady men !
Find your courage.
Or be ready to purpose your fear.
Save yourselves !
Man overboard !
Nay, a deserter!
Come about !
Nay !
Gentlemen, I shall not ask any more of any man than what that man can deliver.
But I do ask this.
Are we not kings men ?
Aye.
On the kings mission ?
I did not notice any fear in the eyes of the Spanish as they passed us by.
Are we not kings men ?
Aye !
Hands aloft and bear away.
Stay on ahead to Whitecap Bay.
Hola.
Come, little drink.
Wine, music, candle light...
I think we've traveled down this road before, Jack.
Yes, we have.
I remember it well.
Winding, twisting, turning, gyrating, writhing...incessant writhing.
You recall Saint Dominic ?
La Martinique.
I tried to kill you in St. Dominique.
??
Hardly appropriate for a first mate.
Was I the first ?
I've often wondered.
You can be so charming when you want something, Jack.
The trick is finding out what.
Truth, then, at least.
Blackbeard has served his purpose, you and I can go to the fountain together.
Where we shall bath one another in equal shares of fame and other assorted debaucheries.
And I tell you the ritual of the fountain.
Yes, the profane ritual.
Can I trust you, Jack?
I need you on this side.
Ah my dearest Angelica.
You and I are as thick as thieves as love.
Tell me the rules.
Water from the fountain of youth...
The simmering tear of a mermaid.
The silver chalices of Ponce de Leon.
Uh huh.
With these items...
Yes ?
With these items, you may take all the years of life from another.
Eh ?
You know what this means?
We cannot go alone, you and I.
The ritual requires a victim.
That is unfortunate.
That's love.
I find my desire for the Fountain greatly lessened.
But there is something on board you do want.
What about Blackbeard ?
He's in the chart room.
We have to be quick.
He keeps each ship as a prize.
You help me, and I promise you your pick.
Though I think I know the one you will chose.
The Black Pearl in a bottle ?
Why is the Black Pearl in a bottle?
That's even more annoying in miniature.
Do we have a deal, Jack?
Angelica, I know you.
You are not going to steal the life of some innocent man.
What about the one taking one.
I need years, Jack.
Not for me.
For my father.
I am, truly the daughter of Blackbeard.
You've fallen for you own con.
No, he is my father.
The lies I told you were not lies.
You lied to me by telling me the truth?
Yes.
That's very good.
May I use that ?
I'm sure you will anyway.
Of course I will.
So will you not give up this quest ?
I want a father, Jack.
I haven't had one.
Angelica...
Your father, Blackbeard...
He is evil and he will kill you.
Given the chance.
He cannot be saved.
And who are you to set the limits on redemption ?
You stole years of my life, Jack.
You owe me.
And you are en-route to getting yourself killed.
And I am not inclined to stand by and watch.
Whitecap Bay!
All hands on deck.
Take to the long boat.
Lay em out flat.
No tangles.
Make em look pretty for out dainty guest.
We're gonna need light.
A lot of light.
Come !
Smell that ?
Whale oil.
Stuff burns like a miracle from god.
Can you make it work?
It's made by the English.
Let's not get our hopes up.
??
moon in the ??
of the new one.
The rest of the summer.
Perfect for hunting a mermaids tears.
We're doomed.
They be drawn to man made light.
Sharks!
Worse than sharks, boy.
There'll be mermaids upon us within the hour.
You mark my words.
And we're the bait.
I heard it said that the kiss from a mermaid can save a sailor from drowning.
Don't be a fool.
Mermaids are all female son, and lovely as the dream of heaven.
But when it comes time to churn butter, so to speak...
They snatch a sailor out of a boat, or off the deck of a ship.
Have their way.
Then the sailors are pulled to bottom.
And drowned.
Aint it ?
Sometimes, the other way around.
Sing.
What ?
They like to 'ear singing.
(singing) Louder!
(continues singing louder) (all join in singing) (singing faintly) Lord save me.
No look...look there.
You'll scare her off!
Aye, and good riddance!
Can you talk ?
Yes.
You're beautiful.
Are you the one who sings?
Aye.
Are you my jolly sailor bold ?
Aye, that I'll be.
Scrum.
Comport yourself.
Boys.
There ain't much been given to me in my brief, miserable life.
There's a truth in it.
But by god.
I'll have it said that Scrum had himself a kiss from a proper mermaid !
(Tamara singing) Out upon it.
It has begun!
Light em up.
Master your courage.
Drive em to shore !
Netting to the water!
Quickly !
Retreat all to land.
For you lives.
Retreat, I say!
Cowards !
Back in the water !
There'll be no refuge on land.
Upon my word.
Come on!
We got one!
I'm in love!
Take the wounded.
See if you can find one mermaid still alive.
Come give a hand.
Well done, sailor.
Did everyone see that ?
Cause I will not be doing it again.
Back to the ship.
We head for protected cove.
Now.
Ooh.
Is that... Mermaid.
Give up this madness now.
I cannot.
Ever walk on the beach, look back and see your footsteps in the sand ?
It's like that, except the footsteps lie before me.
A footstep, actually.
Whitecap Bay sir?
We must hasten.
We travel by foot.
Gibbs, I require a heading.
But, sir, the men.
They be dead already.
But the sound, dammit.
Is that so ?
But I hear nothing but seagulls nesting.
What is it that you hear, Mr. Groves?
Seagulls...nesting.
Nothing more.
Heading, Gibbs?
My God.
Your head, or me heading.
I'll have me one or t'other.
I don't care which.
All hands fore-ward !
It's up to you now, Sparrow.
Was that really necessary ?
Best you not know the exact whereabouts of my ship.
I be a cautious man.
So be I.
What I want first.
Is Ponce De Leon's ship.
Why is it we've got to bring her along ?
Because tears don't keep.
We need them fresh.
What was the ritual, again ?
Water from the fountain and a mermaids tear ?
And two silver chalices.
One cup with a tear, one without.
So one with a tear and water in both.
Quite complicated, is it not?
Both get water.
One gets a tear.
The person who drinks the water with the tear gets all the years of life from the other.
How many years ?
All the years that they have lived.
And they could have lived.
If fate had been kinder.
Clergyman.
On the off chance that this is not their will for me...
I would like it noted, here and now, that I am fully prepared to believe in whatever I must.
So that I may be welcomed into that place where all the goodie goodies get to go.
Savvy ?
We have a word for that, Jack.
You can convert.
I was thinking more of an as needed basis.
Quarter master.
Aye.
She cannot breathe.
She has water.
She needs air !
Open this.
She will escape.
You're killing her.
I support the missionaries position.
See?
Onward !
Just as I thought.
Not this way.
This is the way, isn't it ?
Of course it is.
But we should go around to the east.
That would take us out of the path of the chalices.
Well then we'll chuckle back.
There's no time.
You're the one insisted on bringing the bloody mermaid.
Well the mutiny didn't help.
You walk like a girl.
You would know.
Someone must go.
You mean, split up ?
You mean, jump?
This I cannot wait to see.
Sparrow will go.
Find the ship.
Retrieve the chalices.
Sparrow?
What makes you think he will come back ?
Yes, what makes you think he will come back ?
We cannot trust him, father.
I'll go.
She'll go.
How much farther to the fountain ?
I'm running out of time.
About a days march north, following that river, we'll get to a series of pools.
Then you're close.
You will go.
I was sure it would come to this.
You know that feeling you get sometimes when you're standing in a high place?
Sudden urge to jump?
I don't have it.
I need those chalices.
Shoot.
Save me the bother of the fall.
You will go.
You will return.
Or I will kill her.
You won't kill your own daughter.
Quarter master.
Get me six more pistols and remove the shot from all but two.
But do not tell me which two.
You get to choose, Mr. Sparrow.
That one... that one... No...
Yes.
You're sure?
Of course I am.
Again.
Please.
They're not even loaded.
Again.
If you're so keen on killing her, why don't you just let her jump ?
What?
If you jump and die, then she will have her chance.
Again?
Oy...If I jump...will I survive?
The doll !
Thank you.
(chanting incantation in foreign tongue) (Jack screaming ) Yes, now you will survive.
This is nonsense !
I'm going !
Wet.
Wet again.
We go on.
Due north.
To the fountain.
Well played, father.
You knew which guns were loaded, right ?
Of course, my love.
Be nice to have a map about now.
Or a ship.
Stop.
Hold very still.
You dare not let it touch your skin.
What?
What be wrong with an old man havin a hobby.
What are you stopping for, eh ?
Push on !
Push on.
You'll sleep when you're dead.
Push on !
Fortune continues to favor us.
The Santiago.
Famously captained by Ponce de Len.
Oh.
There's no one there.
Right then.
We must not stop.
You will walk.
I cannot.
Walk or die.
Put your arms around me.
I do not ask for help.
But you need it.
We're in a hurry, yes ?
Do not fall behind.
Wait here until I say.
Such beauty...
Surely you're one of God's own creations.
And not a descendant of those dark creatures who found no refuge on the ark.
Such beauty.
And yet deadly.
Deadly ?
No.
You attacked me.
No.
You are different.
Different ?
Are you not ?
You protect.
You pushed me down out of the way.
You see the Fountain?
No, but we are close.
Bring the creature.
Cover its head.
She has a name!
Pray tell.
She's Syrena.
Ponce de Len.
If 40 pirates dreamt 40 nights of treasure.
It would not match the contents of this room.
You.
You.
No.
You!
I was here first.
You, why are you here?
Blackbeard sent me.
Why are you ?
Silver chalices for my royal liege.
Oh please.
Back, back.
We have to balance it out.
The whole ship will slide.
Right then.
What if...we each choose an item of approximately equal weight.
Put it back!
We touch, nothing.
What about that?
The chalices ?
Oy.
Why do you get to look first !
Fine then.
Together.
Together.
Rocks.
The Spanish.
They're ahead of us, mate.
I shall have a look at that map.
If it's what I fear.
I wonder why they left this behind ?
(whispers) don't touch the map!
Oh !
They know the path.
But I can also see where they'll most likely make camp.
Jack!
Ssh !
Gibbs!
I was just on me way to break you out of jail.
You stole my map.
Right.
Let's be started.
Ole.
Mermaids.
Careful, these pools run deep.
If she escapes, all is lost.
Quarter master.
Look.
Look!
Staked out to die.
Dry in the sun.
Only half in the water.
Not enough to live... ...but just enough to make the dying slow.
Think on it.
Your people murdered.
Harvested for their tears.
Syrena.
Won't you cry ?
All die, even you.
Soon I hear.
Listen.
Listen!
Can you not hear your sisters scream ?
Do you not hear them ?
We need but one tear.
Vile creature.
Chop off her fingers one by one!
Choke her !
Cut out her tears from behind the eyes !
Where's your voice in this ?
At least you'll have a change of heart, when the sun rises.
Aye.
She will burn.
But I cannot wait for the sun.
Perhaps we should build a fire.
No!
Do not contest me, cleric !
You will not torture her !
We need only one tear!
I will tear every scale from her body, one by one if I see fit.
If that displeases you, go pray.
I was wrong.
Not every soul can be saved.
Yours cannot.
Behold gentlemen.
A man formerly of faith.
That vile creature, as you called her, is worth a 100 of you.
Do you care for her ?
You fancy her !
Do not deny what is clear to my eyes.
The question is...
Does she fancy you ?
My god, she does.
We are in luck.
Bring forth a tear.
Or witness the death of this poor soul.
Syrena !
If you can manage a tear.
I will be grateful.
Sadness, yes.
But no sorrow...yet !
Not by your hand, father !
Time and tide wait for none.
Quarter master !
Oh my, mermaids are tough.
The lot of them.
Tie her up like the others.
Get rid of this.
You are confident ?
Yes.
I am a woman.
So is she.
What's your play Jack ?
Throwing in with Barbossa !
There is a girl.
A female...of the opposite sex.
When is there not ?
Perhaps I should say, damsel.
You're rescuing a damsel ?
Well there's a first !
Yes, but it's just that I may have caused said damsel, some manner of harm many moons ago.
Out with it.
Gibbs, this is the woman from Seville.
Ah you pretended to love her, then you left her and broke her heart.
Worse.
I may have had... briefly mind you... Stirrings.
Stirrings ?
Stirrings !
What then.
Feelings you mean ?
No, no, no.
Not quite all the way, feelings, more like... Alright, feelings damn you.
And you left her still.
Oh that's low.
Thank you.
Stealth over force.
I'll take it from here on account of your, condition.
You don't have termites, do you ?
I appreciate your concern, Jack, but I'll be keeping you company all the same.
Hold here, lieutenant commander.
Wait for my signal.
There, that one.
That be the leader.
Make note of his tent, because that's where...
The white picard.
That must be them right there.
Your sword, smells funny.
Aye.
Poison.
From the innards of poisonous toads.
Just a scratch, your a dead man, in minutes.
Would you mind pointing it the other way.
I don't like toads.
What're you doing?
Planning an escape route.
Isn't that how ya do it ?
Yes.
Or sometimes I just, improvise.
Now what ?
We stroll out slow and steady.
I'm sorry, Syrena.
Philip, you're alive!
Yes.
You came for me.
Why?
You're different, are you not?
You know not of kindness, compassion.
Tears of sorrow, never.
Mermaids be too tough for that.
Tears of joy...
They say these be the more potent anyway.
Syrena, on my word, I had no part in this!
Let her go.
You don't need her now.
Let her go?
No.
Secure her bonds.
We leave her with her own.
How's that escape route workin ?
Here's your chance to improvise.
I'm attempting it.
I might be able to get a hand loose.
Oh you've got a knife.
That's very good.
Better.
I want one of those.
Here's to revenge.
Sweet and clear.
Revenge?
Come come, Hector.
If you wanted the chalices, you'd seen they were missing and gone.
You were lying in waiting.
For Blackbeard.
King George, privateer, wig.
Cheap theatrical facade.
Not buying it.
You weren't there that night.
When the Pearl was lost?
Taken, not lost.
We were off the coast of Hispaniola when we came under attack.
No provocation, or warning or offer of parlay.
We were peppered with cannon fire.
And then the sea beneath the Pearl began to roil.
The Pearl was pitching and yawing violently.
Every plank everywhere, every spar all at once, began to creak.
The riggin had come to life.
Our own ship turned against us.
Tangling the crew, wrapping around em like snakes.
Wrapping around me leg.
But me arms were free and me sword was to hand.
I am the master of my ship.
Not Blackbeard.
I am the master of my fate, not Blackbeard.
So I take what needed done.
I survived.
So, you're not after the fountain.
I care not for King George.
Or tavern yarns that give hope for heals limb.
But I'd give me left arm for a chance at Blackbeard.
Not your right?
I need me good arm to drive my poisoned blade through his heart.
I'll see you get the chance, mate.
The prisoner's escaping.
He's escaping !
Follow !
Find him !
Hold your fire.
I want him alive!
I take it that was the signal.
Go !
Prepare to move out !
The enemy is still upon us !
I'm sorry about the chalices, chap... ...but I have an appointment to keep.
I'll not be goin back.
No need.
Shall we have a drink ?
We'll drink at the fountain.
How is it we can never meet without you pointing something at me ?
You brought the chalices, Sparrow?
Aye.
I see you brought a friend.
I did.
And the one legged man.
He is near ?
Aye.
Now, before I go just handing them over, I do have one or two conditions.
Name them.
Firstly, I'll be having me compass back.
No, no.
That's secondly.
Firstly.
On your word.
You'll bring no harm to Angelica.
I'll make no vow to the likes of you, Sparrow.
But it costs me nothing to admit that she was never in harms way.
Secondly then, prior to firstly.
I will be having me compass back.
Please.
I do deserve it.
Do you have any idea how difficult it was to catch that filthy pig?
Not the big one.
The four legged one.
Thank you.
And thirdly, Mr.
Beard.
There are times, not very often...
When I do reflect upon my heinous misdeeds.
Chief among them.
I note how poorly I have treated Mr Gibbs, my loyal first mate.
Hey.
Now you bring it up.
Left him to rot in jail, I did.
Didn't care.
Still Don't.
But, point be.
You must let him go free.
Is that it?
I think so.
Quick, or the pig runs.
And good luck getting those chalices.
Jack, if it's all the same to you, I'd be just as...
Done !
Release the swine.
Perhaps if you don't mind I could tag along with you folk for a...
This will lead you to freedom, mate.
I could have swore it was somewhere right round here.
We must not stop.
Aha.
Dead end.
Dead.
End.
Dead end !
Jack, I'm starting to think you don't know where you're going.
It's not the destination so much as the journey, they say.
Chalices if you please.
Stand back.
Hmm... Jack... Have you ever in fact, seen with your own eyes...
The Fountain of Youth ?
I'm sorry.
Could you repeat the question?
Quarter master.
No, no!
Wait, wait !
Aqua... ...Da Vida.
Master Scrum.
Would you mind.
Do I ?
So beautiful.
Sparrow, I'll be the first to taste those waters.
Father...
The one legged man.
You brought him here!
Would I do that?
Edward Teach... For crimes committed on the high seas.
By the authority granted me... ...by His Majesty the King.
And with a goodly amount of personal satisfaction...
I hereby place you in the custody of the court, and declare you to be my prisoner.
My ??
out.
Is that it ?
Such crimes to include, but are not limited to piracy... ..treason, murder, torture.. ...of the most heinous sort, including the brutal theft of one used, twisted, hairy right leg.
You dare face this sword?
This far away from your ship.
Aye.
Aye... That be the cold breath of fate I feel down my nape ?
But, I'll have one last fight.
By God, kill em all!
Hang on a minute.
I just...
I just need to understand something.
Right... so... You will fight against them.
They will fight against you.
All on account of him, wanting to kill him ?
Where is the sense ?
Exactly.
I say, let them fight each other, while we lay back, watch, have a drink... Place some wagers, eh ?
Aye !
Kill em!
Get off me!
Scrum, the chalices!
And the tear.
Follow!
Hand it over.
The tear.
That's a good lad.
I'm more afraid of her than I am of you.
Hand it over!
There's that good luck ?
The chalices, if you please.
Sorry Jack.
I told you.
I need years.
And now years with you.
Syrena... You will not take her!
You have taken her.
Give...
Her back!
Give her back, please, please !
Hah!
I expected fate to put up more of a fight, eh.
I will not have that smile on your face as I strike you down.
Take a gander, Edward Teach.
This land is hereby forever claimed in the glorious name of his majesty, King George...
Someone make a note, of that mans bravery.
Senorita, the chalices.
Por Favor.
Only God can grant eternal life.
Not this pagan water.
Men, destroy this profane temple !
The fountain!
You are a fool.
You seek in this place what only faith can provide.
Faith?
In faith there is light enough to see the darkness enough... ...to blind.
And devil is this ?
For the Pearl!
What have you done ?
Angelica, don't!
It's poison!
I'm not such the fool to take on Blackbeard... ...without a little venomous advantage.
Jack!
I claim Blackbeard's ship and crew.
And this sword, payment for my missin limb.
Vaminos!
Do not waste my tear.
Drink this.
This one has the tear.
You must drink the other.
No!
I cannot save you both.
One of you must sacrifice.
You take it father, for your soul.
Captain Teach, she's dying.
You must save your daughter.
This one takes life ?
This one has the tear and gives life ?
Aye.
Hurry !
Angelica... Save me, my child.
No!
I love you, father.
Wait a minute.
In fact, it might have been the other way around.
This cup had the tear.
That one had the... other bit.
Trickster !
Devil !
Father!
You bastard!
How could you?
Your father saved you.
Perhaps his soul is now redeemed, eh.
You're hurt.
Body, only.
My mind is at peace.
Cause of you.
Me?
Yes.
I was lost... ...the wind.
The tides...
They truly knew mans fate.
For me, only you.
Philip, I can save you.
You need only ask.
I seek but one thing.
What is that?
Forgiveness.
If not for me you would never have been captured.
Ask !
Forgive me.
I hate you!
The bloke that saved your life.
The years I possess.
Stolen from my own father.
I only helped Blackbeard do what any father should have done.
You're cruel and ignorant.
One pistol.
One shot.
To kill myself before I starve ?
Is there trust in you, love.
Besides, this is a well traveled trade route.
You can signal a passing ship.
Or you can just bite the proverbial bullet as it were.
And how will I get free of these bonds ?
You broke free of your bonds half an hour ago.
Waiting for the precise moment to pounce.
Admit it Jack.
You still love me.
If you had a sister and a dog, I'd choose the dog.
Treasure!
There is a chest with jewels.
Jewels with the power to rule the wind and tide.
You're making that up!
Wait.
I am with child.
Yours !
I don't recall that we ever had... You were drunk!
I've actually never been that drunk.
Wait!
There's something I want to say to you.
Something I wanted to say, from the moment we first met.
Go on then.
I love you.
As do I.
Always have, always will.
I gotta go.
Jack!
This is not over!
Jack!
Missed!
(Angelica yelling) The Revenge is mine.
Sir.
I found this below deck.
All hands, ride to windward.
Get back on ya bloomin cockroaches The crown served me well.
But now by the gods of sea and sky... Make way for Tortuga!
Gibbs, you filthy besotted ??
you made it!
Aye.
And I trust we managed a profit from our joint enterprise.
Feast your eyes!
The compass led me straight and true.
What of Blackbeards men guarding the ship ?
I employed the self same maneuver we perfected in New Guinea.
Seemed a shame to leave an entire fleet behind.
Shame indeed.
I hate that monkey!
So, the Pearl.
Any idea how to get her out ?
We shall need a crossbow, an hourglass, three goats... ...one of us must learn to play the trumpet.
Whilst the other one goes like this.
I know a man with a goat.
Good!
I can go like this.
Jack, I have to ask... You had the chalices, the water, the tear.
You could have lived... maybe forever !
The fountain does ??
your years.
But better to not know which moment may be your last.
Every morsel of your entire being alive to the infinite mystery of it all.
And who's to say I won't live forever, eh?
Discoverer of the Fountain of Youth.
I have no say in it, Gibbs.
It's a pirates life for me.
Savvy ?

Particularly a woman.
Particularly a woman alone.
[Man] What makes you think she's alone?
You protect her?
And what makes you think I need protecting?
Your master's expecting us.
And an unexpected death'd cast a slight pall on our meeting.
[Man 2] Pick those feet up!
On the double!
Eyes front!
[Man 2] No, no, no.
None.
[Footsteps marching] [Man] lt always takes me about a week to get my sea legs.
I was throwing up horribly the last time.
[Squawk] Steady as she goes.
[Hurdy-gurdy music plays] All right.
Have you heard anything from Will?
I trust young Turner to acquire the charts and you to remember your place in the presence of Captain Sao Feng.
Is he that terrifying?
He's much like myself, but absent my merciful nature and sense of fair play.
[Speaks in Chinese] [Metal cracks] We're through.
Make ready.
[Creaking] Hurry now.
Do you think because she is a woman we would not suspect her of treachery?
Well, when you put it that way...
Remove.
Please.
Remove.
Please.
Captain Barbossa, welcome to Singapore.
[Sniffles] More steam.
[Hissing] [Men shouting in Chinese] [Grunting] None of that.
If things don't go the way we want, then we're the only chance they've got.
I understand that you have a request to make of me.
More of a proposal to put to ye.
I've a venture underway and I find myself in need of a ship and a crew.
Hmm.
It's an odd coincidence.
Because you happen to have a ship and a crew you don't need?
No.
Because earlier this day, not far from here, a thief broke into my most revered uncle's temple and tried to make off with these.
The navigational charts.
The route to the Farthest Gate.
Wouldrt it be amazing if this venture of yours took you to the world beyond this one?
Lt would strain credulity at that.
[Splashing] [Gasping] This is the thief.
Is his face familiar to you?
Then I guess he has no further need for it.
No, no!
You come into my city and you betray my hospitality.
I assure you I had no idea... That he would get caught!
You intend to attempt the voyage to Davy Jones' Locker.
But I cannot help but wonder... Why?
The song has been sung.
The time is upon us.
We must convene the Brethren Court.
As one of the nine pirate lords, you must honor the call.
More steam.
More steam!
[Groans] There is a price on all our heads.
Aye.
It is true.
It seems the only way a pirate can turn a profit anymore... ...is by betraying other pirates.
[Barbossa] We must put our differences aside.
Wait for the signal.
[Barbossa] The First Brethren Court gave us rule of the seas.
But now that rule is being challenged by Lord Cutler Beckett.
[Sao Feng] Against East India Trading Company, what value is the Brethren Court?
What can any of us do?
You can fight!
Get off me!
You are Sao Feng, the pirate lord of Singapore.
You command in an age of piracy where bold captains sail free waters.
Where waves aren't measured in feet, but as increments of fear, and those who pass the test become legend.
Would you have that era come to an end on your watch?
The most notorious pirates from around the world are uniting against our enemy, and yet you sit here cowering in your bathwater!
Elizabeth Swann.
There is more to you than meets the eye, isn't there?
And the eye does not go wanting.
But I cannot help but notice you have failed to answer my question.
What is it you seek in Davy Jones' Locker?
Jack Sparrow.
[Giggling] He's one of the pirate lords.
[Sao Feng] The only reason...
...I would want Jack Sparrow returned from the land of the dead... ...is so I can send him back myself!
Jack Sparrow holds one of the nine pieces of eight.
He failed to pass it along to a successor before he died.
So we must go and get him back.
So you admit... ...you have deceived me.
Weapons!
[Yelling] Weapons.
Sao Feng, I assure you, our intentions are strictly honorable.
Drop your weapons or I kill the man!
Kill him.
He's not our man.
If he's not with you, and he's not with us... ...who's he with?
[Door opens] Charge!
Will!
[Gasps] [Man] Look out!
Look behind you!
[Clamoring] Ready!
Fire.
[Shouts] Chart!
Boo!
Company!
Make ready.
Set.
Fire!
Company!
Make ready.
Set.
[Hurdy-gurdy music playing] Fire!
[Explosion] [Shouting and gunfire continues] [Metal clanging on floor] Lt's an odd coincidence, isn't it?
The East India Trading Company finds me the day you show up in Singapore.
It is coincidence only.
[Gun cocks] Lf you want to make a deal with Beckett, you need what I offer.
You cross Barbossa.
You are willing to cross Jack Sparrow.
Why should I expect any better?
I need the Black Pearl to free my father.
You're helping me to get it.
[Squawks] Uh-oh.
Fire in the hole.
[Popping and exploding] [Man screaming] Thank you, Jack.
[Screeches] [Squawk] Thank you, Jack.
You have the charts?
And better yet.
A ship and a crew.
Where's Sao Feng?
He'll cover our escape and meet us at Shipwreck Cove.
This way.
Be quick.
[Gibbs] Haul the snotters with a will!
[Pintel] Keep it taut.
[Gibbs] Secure provisions and stow the cargo.
There's no place left for Sao Feng to cower.
Do you think he will honor the call?
I cannot say.
There's an evil on these seas that even the most staunch and bloodthirsty pirates have come to fear.
[Cannon fire booming] A piece of eight.
Nine of them, you say.
Our new friend in Singapore was very specific, sir.
Nine pieces of eight.
What's the significance of that, I wonder.
Nothing can hold against the armada.
Not with the Flying Dutchman at the lead.
Nothing we know of.
Did your friend mention where the Brethren Court are meeting?
He was mum on that, sir.
Hmm.
Then he knows the value of information.
Better keep this between ourselves.
We don't want anyone running off to Singapore, do we?
Ah, admiral.
You summoned me, Lord Beckett.
Yes.
Something for you there.
Your new station deserves an old friend.
Not more requisition orders.
No, sir.
Execution.
[Sword unsheathed] The Brethren know they face extinction.
All that remains is for them to decide where they make their final stand.
No one said anything about cold.
I'm sure there must be a good reason for our suffering.
Why don't that obeah woman bring Jack back the same way she brought back Barbossa?
Because Barbossa was only dead.
Jack Sparrow is taken, body and soul, to a place not of death, but punishment.
The worst fate a person can bring upon himself... ...stretching on forever.
That's what awaits at Davy Jones' Locker.
Yeah.
I knew there was a good reason.
[Groaning] [Shudders] Nothing here is set.
These can't be as accurate as modern charts.
No.
But it leads to more places.
"Over the edge.
Over again."
"Sunrise sets.
Flash of green."
Do you care to interpret, Captain Barbossa?
Ever gazed upon the green flash, Master Gibbs?
I reckon I seen my fair share.
Happens on rare occasion.
The last glimpse of sunset, a green flash shoots up into the sky.
Some go their whole lives without ever seeing it.
Some claim to have seen it who ain't.
And some say...
It signals when a soul comes back to this world from the dead.
Sorry.
Trust me, young Master Turner.
It's not getting to the land of the dead that's the problem.
It's getting back.
[Man] Bosun!
Head to wind!
Lift the sail!
[Man] Bosun!
Head to wind!
Lift the sail!
[Man 2] Aye, aye, sir!
Bloody hell.
There's nothing left.
Jones is a loose cannon, sir.
Fetch the chest.
And the governor?
He's been asking questions about the heart.
Does he know?
Then perhaps his usefulness has run its course.
[Organ playing] [Sighing] [Music box playing] [Music box stops] [Man] Step lively, men.
Step lively!
Stand fast!
Steady, men.
Go.
All of you.
And take that infernal thing with you.
I will not have it on my ship!
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that... because I will.
Because it seems to be the only way to ensure that this ship do as directed by the company.
We need prisoners to interrogate, which tends to work best when they're alive.
The Dutchman sails as its captain commands.
And its captain is to sail it as commanded.
I would have thought you'd learned that when I ordered you to kill your pet.
This is no longer your world, Jones.
The immaterial has become... ...immaterial.
[Norrington] Charge your bayonets.
[Heartbeat] How long do we continue not talking?
Once we rescue Jack, everything'll be fine.
Then we rescue Jack.
For what we want most... ...there is a cost must be paid in the end.
Barbossa, ahead!
Aye, we're good and lost now.
Lost?
For certain you have to be lost to find a place as can't be found.
Elseways, everyone would know where it was.
We're gaining speed.
Aye.
To stations!
All hands to stations!
[Men shouting] Huh?
Rudder full.
Hard aport!
Gather way.
Nay!
Belay that!
Let her run straight and true!
Blimey.
You've doomed us all.
Don't be so unkind.
You may not survive to pass this way again, and these be the last friendly words you'll hear.
Tie her off.
[Muttering] Hard aport.
[Men shouting] Hold on!
[Music playing] [Cannons firing] [Man laughs] Strike your colors, you blooming cockroaches.
[Man 2] Dead men tell no tales.
[Echoing] [Man sniffing] [Gunshot] My peanut.
Haul the halyard.
Slacken braces.
Aye, captain.
Slacken braces.
Step lively with a will.
Aye, aye.
Right away, sir.
I want a fire down below!
Help.
Man the yards, you filthy toads.
[Muffled groaning] [Clucking] [All] Haul!
Haul!
Haul the sheets handsomely.
Scandalize the lateens.
Aye, sir.
Right away, sir.
Mr. Sparrow?
Aye, cap'n.
What say you about the condition of this tack line?
It be proper to my eyes, sir.
Proper?
Lt is neither proper nor suitable, sir.
It is not acceptable nor adequate.
It is, in obvious fact, an abomination.
Begging your pardon, sir, but if you gave a man another chance.
Shall I?
[Unsheathes sword] Lt's that sort of thinking got us into this mess.
We have lost speed and, therefore, time.
Precious time, which cannot be recovered once lost.
Do you understand?
[All] Aye, aye, captain.
Do you now?
Lt will all have to be redone.
All of it.
And let this serve as a lesson to the lot of you.
Doldrums, sir, has the entire crew on edge.
I have no sympathy for any of you feculent maggots, and no more patience to pretend otherwise.
Gentlemen, I wash my hands of this weirdness.
No wind.
Of course, there's no bloody wind.
My soul I do swear for a breeze.
Gust.
Whisper.
A tiny, miniature lick.
Yes, sir, I know, but why?
Why would he do that?
Because he's a lummox, isn't he?
We shall have a magnificent garden party and you're not invited.
Shoo.
A rock.
Now we're being followed by rocks.
Never had that before.
Oh.
A rope.
[Grunting] [Panting] [Rumbling] [Coughing and gagging] This truly is a godforsaken place.
I don't see Jack.
I don't see anyone.
He's here.
Davy Jones never once gave up that what he took.
And does it matter?
We're trapped here by your doing.
No different than Jack.
Witty Jack is closer than you think.
Impossible.
Boat.
Slap me thrice and hand me to me mama.
It's Jack.
It's the captain!
A sight for sore eyes.
[Parrot] Hide the rum.
Mr. Gibbs.
Aye, cap'n.
I thought so.
I expect you're able to account for your actions, then.
Sir?
There's been a perpetual and virulent lack of discipline upon my vessel.
Why?
Why is that, sir?
Sir, you're... You're in Davy Jones' Locker, cap'n.
I know that.
I know where I am.
And don't think I don't.
Jack Sparrow.
Oh, Hector.
It's been too long.
Hasrt it?
Aye.
Isla de Muerta, remember?
You shot me.
No, I didn't.
Tia Dalma, out and about, eh?
You add an agreeable sense of the macabre to any delirium.
He thinks we're a hallucination.
William, tell me something: Have you come because you need my help to save a certain distressing damsel, or rather, damsel in distress?
Either one.
No.
Well, then, you wouldn't be here, would you?
So you can't be here.
Q.E.D., you're not really here.
[Elizabeth] Jack.
This is real.
We're here.
The Locker, you say?
Aye.
We've come to rescue you.
Have you, now?
That's very kind of you.
But it would seem that as I possess a ship and you don't, you're the ones in need of rescuing, and I'm not sure as I'm in the mood.
I see my ship.
Right there.
Can't spot it.
Must be a tiny little thing hiding somewhere behind the Pearl.
Jack, Cutler Beckett has the heart of Davy Jones.
He controls the Flying Dutchman.
He's taking over the seas.
The song has been sung.
The Brethren Court is called.
Leave you alone for a minute, look what happens.
Everything's gone to pot.
Aye.
The world needs you back something fierce.
And you need a crew.
Why should I sail with any of you?
Four of you have tried to kill me in the past.
One of you succeeded.
Oh, she's not told you.
You'll have loads to talk about while you're here.
As for you... Now... don't tell me you didn't enjoy it at the time.
Fair enough.
All right, you're in.
Don't need you.
You scare me.
Gibbs, you can come.
Marty.
Mm... Cotton.
[Parrot squawks] Cottors parrot, I'm a little iffy, but at least I'll have someone to talk to.
Who are you?
Tai Huang.
These are my men.
Where do your allegiances lie?
With the highest bidder.
I have a ship.
That makes you the highest bidder.
Good man.
Weigh anchor, all hands.
Prepare to make sail.
[Parrot] Weigh anchor.
[Barbossa] Jack...
Which way are you going, Jack?
Trim that sail.
Slack windward brace and sheet.
Haul the pennant line.
Haul the pennant line.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
No, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
No, what are you doing?
What are you?
Captain gives orders on the ship.
The captain of the ship is giving orders.
My ship, makes me captain.
They be my charts.
That makes you "chartman."
Stow it!
The both of you!
That's an order!
Understand?!
Sorry.
I just thought with the captain issue in doubt, I'd throw in my name for consideration.
Sorry.
I'd vote for you.
Yeah?
You left Jack to the Kraken.
He's rescued now.
It's done with.
Will, I had no choice.
You chose not to tell me.
I couldn't.
It wasrt your burden to bear.
But I did bear it, didn't I?
I just didn't know what it was.
I thought... You thought I loved him.
If you make your choices alone, how can I trust you?
You can't.
[Ship creaking] [Gasps] Eerie.
That's downright macabre.
I wonder what would happen if you dropped a cannonball on one of them?
[Both chuckling] Be disrespectful, it would.
They should be in the care of Davy Jones.
That was the duty him was charged with... ...by the goddess, Calypso.
To ferry those who die at sea to the other side.
And every ten years... ...him could come ashore... ...to be with she who love him... truly.
But the man has become a monster.
So he wasrt always... tentacley?
No.
Him was a man... ...once.
Now there's boats coming.
They're not a threat to us.
Am I right?
We are nothing but ghosts to them.
It's best just let them be.
It's my father.
We've made it back.
Father!
Father, here, look here!
Elizabeth.
We're not back.
Father!
Elizabeth.
Are you dead?
No.
No.
I think I am.
No, you can't be.
There was this chest, you see.
It's odd.
At the time it seemed so important.
Come aboard.
And a heart.
I learned that if you stab the heart, yours must take its place.
And you will sail the seas for eternity.
The Dutchman must have a captain.
Silly thing to die for.
Someone, cast a line.
Come back with us!
Come on.
A touch... of destiny.
Take the line.
I'm so proud of you, Elizabeth.
Father, the line!
Take the line!
She must not leave the ship!
Father!
Please come with us!
Please!
No!
I won't leave you!
I'll give your love to your mother.
Please, I won't let you go!
Elizabeth.
Elizabeth.
[Sobbing] Is there a way?
Him at peace.
No water.
Why is all but the rum gone?
Rum's gone too.
If we cannot escape these doldrums before night, I fear we will sail on trackless seas.
Doomed to roam the reach between worlds.
Forever.
With no water, forever looks to be arriving a mite too soon.
Why doesn't he do something?
[Ragetti] Me eye.
Give it back!
There's no sense to it.
And the green flash happens at sunset, not sunrise.
[Gibbs] "Over the edge."
Ah, it's driving me over the blooming edge.
Sunrises don't set.
[Jack] "Up is down."
Well, that's just maddeningly unelpful.
Why are these things never clear?
Clear as mud, Jackie.
What?
Eh?
Stab the heart.
Don't stab the heart.
Come again?
The Dutchman must have a captain.
That's even more than less than unelpful.
Sail the seas for eternity.
I love the sea.
What about port?
I prefer rum.
Rum's good.
Making port.
Where we can get rum, and salty wenches... Once every 10 years.
What'd he say?
Once every 10 years.
Ten years is a long time, mate.
Even longer given the deficit of rum.
But eternity is longer still.
And how will you be spending it?
Dead?
Or not?
The immortal Captain Sparrow.
Oh, I like that.
Come sunset, it won't matter.
Not sunset.
Sundown.
And rise.
Up.
What's that?
What is that?
I don't know.
What do you think?
Where?
There.
[Jack grunting, stammers] What is it?
He's rocking the ship.
We're rocking the ship.
Aye.
He's onto it.
[Creaking] He's rocking the ship.
We'll tie each other to the mast upside down, so when the boat flips we'll be the right way up.
Time it with the swell.
Loose the cannons, you lazy bilge rats.
Unstow the cargo.
Let it shift.
[Crew shouting in Chinese] [Ship creaking] [Screaming] Now up... ...is down.
[Coughing] [Squawks] This was your idea.
Blessed sweet westerlies!
We're back!
Lt's the sunrise.
[Screeches] Parley?
We need our pistols!
Get untied, hurry!
All right, then!
The Brethren Court is a-gathering at Shipwreck Cove.
And, Jack, you and I are a-going.
There'll be no arguing that point.
I is arguing the point.
If there's pirates a-gathering, I'm pointing my ship the other way.
The pirates are gathering to fight Beckett, and you're a pirate.
Fight or not, you're not running, Jack.
If we don't stand together, they'll hunt us down one by one, till there be none left but you.
Quite like the sound of that.
Captain Jack Sparrow, the last pirate.
Aye.
And you'll be fighting Jones alone.
How does that figure into your plan?
I'm still working on that.
But I will not be going back to the Locker, mate.
Count on that.
[Clicks] [Guns clicking] Wet powder.
Wait!
We can still use them as clubs!
Ow!
Sorry.
Effective, though.
There's fresh water on this island.
We can resupply there and get back to shooting each other later.
You lead the shore party.
I'll stay with my ship.
I'll not be leaving my ship in your command.
Why don't you both go ashore and leave the ship in my command.
Temporarily.
[Telescope opening] [Shouting] [Squawks] Mind the boat.
Criminy.
Odds bodkins!
[Seagulls cawing] Careful!
Careful!
You stupid fish!
Actually it's a cephalopod.
Serves you right.
[Ragetti] Pin, I bet people would pay a shilling to see this.
And another shilling for a sketch of them sitting atop!
Pintel and Ragetti, Kraken slayers.
[Ragetti] We could serve up a slice as a souvenir.
Still thinking of running, Jack?
Think you can outrun the world?
You know, the problem with being the last of anything... ...by and by, there be none left at all.
Sometimes things come back, mate.
We're living proof, you and me.
Aye, but that's a gamble of long odds, ain't it?
There's never a guarantee of coming back.
But passing on, that's dead certain.
Summoning the Brethren Court, then, is it?
Lt's our only hope, lad.
That's a sad commentary in and of itself.
The world used to be a bigger place.
The world's still the same.
There's just... less in it.
Poisoned.
Fouled by the body.
Eh, I know him.
He was in Singapore!
[Squawks] Singapore.
Captain!
Hoy!
We got company!
He's the captain.
[Shouting] Sao Feng... ...you showing up here, it is truly a remarkable coincidence.
[Sao Feng] Jack Sparrow.
You paid me great insult once.
That doesn't sound like me.
[Groans] Shall we just call it square, then?
Release her.
She's not part of the bargain.
And what bargain be that?
You heard Captain Turner.
Release her!
"Captain Turner"?
Aye, the perfidious rotter led a mutiny against us!
I need the Pearl to free my father.
That's the only reason I came on this voyage.
Why didn't you tell me you were planning this?
Lt was my burden to bear.
He needs the Pearl.
Captain Turner needs the Pearl.
And you felt guilty.
And you and your Brethren Court.
Did no one come to save me just because they missed me?
I'm standing with them.
I'm sorry, Jack, but there is an old friend who wants to see you first.
I'm not certain I can survive any more visits from old friends.
Here is your chance to find out.
Curious.
Your friends appear to be quite desperate, Jack.
Perhaps they no longer believe that a gathering of squabbling pirates can defeat the Flying Dutchman.
And so despair leads to betrayal.
But you and I are no strangers to betrayal, are we?
Lt's not here, Jack.
What?
What isn't?
The heart of Davy Jones.
It's safely aboard the Dutchman, and so unavailable for use as leverage to satisfy your debt to the good captain.
By my reckoning, that account has been settled.
[Beckett] By your death?
And yet here you are.
Close your eyes and pretend it's all a bad dream.
That's how I get by.
And if Davy Jones were to learn of your survival?
[Man] Ship oars.
[Man 2] Ship oars.
Be on your guard, men.
My men are crew enough.
Company ship, company crew.
You agreed.
The Black Pearl was to be mine.
And so it was.
[Beckett] Perhaps you'll consider an alternative arrangement.
One which requires absolutely nothing from you but information.
Regarding the Brethren Court, no doubt.
In exchange for fair compensation?
Square my debt with Jones... ...guarantee my freedom?
Of course.
It's just good business.
Were I in a divulgatory mood, what then might I divulge?
Everything.
Where are they meeting?
Who are the pirate lords?
What is the purpose of the nine pieces of eight?
[Man] Prepare the brig.
Beckett agreed the Black Pearl was to be mine.
He's not going to give up the only ship as can outrun the Dutchman, is he?
Shame they're not bound to honor the code of the Brethren, isn't it?
Because honor's a hard thing to come by nowadays.
There is no honor to remaining with the losing side.
Leaving it for the winning side, that's just good business.
The losing side, you say?
They have the Dutchman.
Now the Pearl!
And what do the Brethren have?
We have Calypso.
[Laughs] Calypso.
An old legend.
No.
The goddess herself, bound in human form.
Imagine all the power of the seas brought to bear against our enemy.
I intend to release her.
But for that I need the Brethren Court.
All the Court.
You can keep Barbossa.
The belligerent homunculus and his friend with the wooden eye, both.
And Turner.
Especially Turner.
The rest go with me on the Pearl.
I'll lead you to Shipwreck Cove, where I will hand you the pirates and you will not hand me to Jones.
Bloody fair deal, don't you think?
And what becomes of Miss Swann?
What interest is she to you?
What are you proposing, captain?
What be accepting, cap'n?
The girl.
What?
Jack.
I've just recalled.
I've got this wonderful compass, which points to whatever I want.
So for what do I need you?
Elizabeth is not part of any bargain.
Out of the question.
It was not a question.
Points to the thing you want most.
And that is not the Brethren Court, is it?
Then what is, Jack?
Me.
Dead.
Done.
What?
Not done.
You got us into this.
If it frees us, then done!
Damn.
Although, if I kill you, then I can use the compass to find Shipwreck Cove, is it, on my own.
Cut out the middle man, as it were.
Elizabeth, they are pirates.
I have had more than enough experience dealing with pirates!
Then we have an accord?
With me killed, you'd arrive at the cove, find it a stronghold, nigh impregnable... ...able to withstand blockade for years.
Then you'd be wishing, "lf only there was someone I had not killed inside to ensure that the pirates then come outside."
And you can accomplish all this?
You may kill me, but you may never insult me.
Who am I?
I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.
[Rumbling] Done!
[Man shouting] [Cannon fire] [Man] Man overboard!
You're mad.
Thank goodness.
If I wasrt, this'd probably never work.
[Jack shouting] And that was without even a single drop of rum.
Send this pestilent, traitorous, cowhearted, yeasty codpiece to the brig.
Which ship do we follow?
Signal the Dutchman to track down Sao Feng.
We follow the Pearl.
How soon can we have the ship ready to pursue?
[Wood cracking] [Man] She's going down!
[Man 2] Stand clear!
Do you think he plans it all out, or just makes it up as he goes along?
Sir.
[Speaking Chinese] By this time tomorrow, we will arrive at Shipwreck Cove and you will be free.
Calypso.
Excuse me?
Not a name you fancy, I imagine, out of the many that you have... ...but it is what we call you.
We being who?
You confirm it.
Confirm what?
You've told me nothing.
The Brethren Court, not I.
The First Brethren Court, whose decision I would have opposed.
They bound you to human form so the rule of the seas would belong to man and not... To me.
But one such as you should never be anything less than what you are.
Pretty speech from a captor.
But words whispered through prison bars lose their charm.
Can I be blamed for my efforts?
All men are drawn to the sea, perilous though it may be.
And some men offer desire as justification for their crimes.
I offer simply my desire.
And in return?
I would have your gifts, should you choose to give them.
And if I should choose not?
Then I will take... ...your fury.
[Grunting] [Elizabeth panting] [Pirates shouting] Sao Feng?
Here.
Please.
With all nine pieces of eight... ...you will be free.
Take it!
You are captain now.
Me?
Go in my place to Shipwreck Cove.
Captain!
The ship is taken.
We cannot... Forgive me... Calypso.
[Explosions and shouting] Sao.
What did he tell you?
He made me captain.
Set!
Fire!
You are not my captain.
Elizabeth.
James.
James.
Thank God, you're alive.
Your father'll be overjoyed to know you're safe.
My father's dead.
No, that can't be true.
He returned to England.
Did Lord Beckett tell you that?
Who among you do you name as captain?
Captain.
Her.
[All] Her.
Captain?
Tow the ship.
Put the prisoners in the brig.
The captain shall have my quarters.
Thank you, sir.
But I prefer to remain with my crew.
Elizabeth.
I swear.
I did not know.
Know what?
Which side you chose?
Well, now you do.
Bootstrap?
[Chuckling] Bootstrap.
Bill Turner?
[Man] Bootstrap.
You know my name.
Yes, I know your son.
Will Turner.
William.
He made it.
He's alive.
And now he sends you to tell me that he's coming to get me.
God's wounds.
He's on his way.
Yes, Will is alive.
And he wants to help you.
He can't help me.
He won't come.
But you're his father.
I know you.
He spoke of you.
He can't save me.
He can't come because of you.
Me?
You're Elizabeth.
Yes, I'm Elizabeth.
If Jones be slain, he who slays him must take his place.
Captain...
Forever.
The Dutchman must always have a captain.
And if he saves me... ...he loses you.
I see.
He won't pick me.
I wouldn't pick me.
Tell him not to come.
Tell him to stay away.
Tell him it's too late.
I'm already a part of the ship... ...and the crew.
Bootstrap.
You know my name.
You know my name.
Yes, I know your son.
William.
He's coming for me.
Wait and see.
You'll see.
He promised.
[Man] Swing her over.
Ready those lines.
Sir.
[Beckett] A breadcrumb trail.
And we're meant to follow.
A betrayer among them?
Or a trap?
A gambit by a skilled opponent.
Adjust course, lieutenant.
Sir?
We can only hope to reach our destination before they run out of bodies.
You escaped the brig even quicker than I expected.
William, do you notice anything?
Rather... ...do you notice something that is not there to be noticed?
You haven't raised an alarm.
Odd, isn't it?
Not as odd as this.
Come up with this all by your lonesome, did you?
I said to myself, "Think like Jack."
This is what you've arrived at?
Lead Beckett to Shipwreck Cove so as to gain his trust... ...accomplish your own ends?
Lt's like you don't know me at all.
And how does your dearly beloved feel about this plan?
Ah.
You've not seen fit to trust her with it.
I'm losing her, Jack.
Every step I make for my father is a step away from Elizabeth.
If you choose to lock your heart away, you'll lose her for certain.
If I might lend a machete to your intellectual thicket... ...avoid the choice altogether.
Change the facts.
Let someone else dispatch Jones.
Who?
You?
Death has a curious way of reshuffling one's priorities.
I slip aboard the Dutchman, find the heart, stab the beating thing, your father's free from his debt, you're free to be with your charming murderess.
You're willing to cut out your heart and bind yourself to the Dutchman... ...forever?
No, mate.
I'm free forever.
Free to sail the seas beyond the edges of the map.
Free from death itself.
You have to do the job though, Jack.
You have to ferry souls to the next world.
Or end up just like Jones.
[Groans] I don't have the face for tentacles.
But immortal has to count for something, eh?
What's this for?
Think like me.
It'll come to you.
My regards to Davy Jones.
I hate him.
Come with me.
Quickly.
What are you doing?
Choosing a side.
[Whispering in Chinese] Do not go to Shipwreck Cove.
Beckett knows of the meeting of the Brethren.
I fear there may be a traitor among them.
It's too late to earn my forgiveness.
I had nothing to do with your father's death.
But that does not absolve me of my other sins.
Come with us.
James, come with me.
[Bootstrap Bill] Who goes there?
Go.
I will follow.
You're lying.
Our destinies have been entwined, Elizabeth... ...but never joined.
Go, now.
Back to your station, sailor.
No one leaves the ship.
Stand down.
That's an order.
That's an order.
Part of the crew, part of the ship.
Part of the crew, part of the ship.
Part of the crew...
Steady, man.
Part of the crew, part of the ship.
All hands, prisoner escape!
Belay that!
James!
[Screaming] [Man] Prisoner escape!
James!
No!
The admiral's dead.
Admiral's dead?
The admiral's dead.
Admiral's dead.
To the captairs cabin!
[All] Aye!
Back to the ship.
James Norrington.
Do you fear death?
I take that as a "no."
Nice sword.
The Dutchman is under my command.
For now.
Look alive and keep a weather eye.
Not for naught it's called Shipwreck Island.
Where lies Shipwreck Cove and the town of Shipwreck.
You heard him.
Step lively.
For all that pirates are clever clogs, we are unimaginative when it comes to naming things.
Aye.
I once sailed with a geezer who lost both of his arms and part of his eye.
What'd you call him?
Larry.
I do not renege on a bargain once struck.
But we agreed on ends only.
The means are mine to decide.
Caution, Barbossa.
Do not forget it was by my power you return from the dead.
Or what it mean if you fail me.
Don't you forget why you had to bring me back.
Why I could not leave Jack to his well-deserved fate.
It took nine pirate lords to bind you, Calypso.
And it'll take no less than nine to set you free.
Masters Pintel and Ragetti.
Take this fishwife to the brig.
Right this way, Mrs.
Fish.
I cannot be summoned like some mongrel pup.
Apparently, you can.
I believe you know each other.
[Chuckles] Come to join my crew again, Master Turner?
Not yours.
His.
Jack Sparrow sends his regards.
Sparrow?
You didn't tell him.
We rescued Jack from the Locker along with the Black Pearl.
What else have you not told me?
There is an issue far more troublesome.
I believe you're familiar with a person called Calypso.
Not a person.
A heathen god.
One who delights in cursing men with their wildest dreams and then revealing them to be hollow and naught but ash.
The world is well rid of her.
Not quite so well, actually.
The Brethren Court intends to release her.
No!
They cannot!
The First Court promised to imprison her forever.
That was our agreement.
Your agreement?
I showed them how to bind her.
She could not be trusted.
I... She gave me no choice.
We must act before they release her.
You loved her.
She's the one.
And then you betrayed her.
She pretended to love me.
She betrayed me.
And after which betrayal did you cut out your heart, I wonder.
Do not test me.
I hadrt finished that.
You will free my father.
And you will guarantee Elizabeth's safety.
Along with my own.
Your terms are steep, Mr. Turner.
We will expect fair value in return.
There is only one price I will accept: Calypso murdered.
Calypso's aboard the Black Pearl.
Jack has sailed the Black Pearl to Shipwreck Cove.
And with you no longer aboard her, how do you propose to lead us there?
What is it you want most?
Look at them all.
There's not been a gathering like this in our lifetime.
And I owe them all money.
[Murmuring] As he who issued summons, I convene this, the Fourth Brethren Court.
[Murmuring] To confirm your lordship and right to be heard, present now your pieces of eight, my fellow cap'ns.
Those aren't pieces of eight.
They're just pieces of junk.
Aye.
The original plan was to use nine pieces of eight to bind Calypso.
But when the First Court met, the Brethren were to a one skint broke.
So change the name.
To "nine pieces of whatever we happened to have in our pockets at the time?"
Oh, yes.
That sounds very piratey.
Master Ragetti, if you will.
I kept it safe, just like you said when you gave it to me.
Aye, you have.
But now I need it back.
Sparrow.
Might I point out that we are still short one pirate lord, and I'm as content as a cucumber to wait until Sao Feng joins us.
[Elizabeth] Sao Feng is dead.
He fell to the Flying Dutchman.
The plagued ship.
He made you captain?
They're giving the bloody title away now.
Que lo manden al diablo!
Listen.
Listen to me.
Our location has been betrayed.
Jones is under the command of Lord Beckett.
They're on their way here.
Who is this betrayer?
Not likely anyone among us.
Where's Will?
Not among us.
It matters not how they found us.
The question is, what will we do now that they have?
We fight.
Shipwreck Cove is a fortress.
A well-supplied fortress.
There is no need to fight if they cannot get to us.
There be a third course.
In another age, at this very spot, the First Brethren Court captured the sea goddess and bound her in her bones.
That was a mistake.
Oh, we tamed the seas for ourselves, aye.
But opened the door to Beckett and his ilk.
Better were the days when mastery of seas came not from bargains struck with eldritch creatures, but from the sweat of a mars brow and the strength of his back alone.
You all know this to be true.
Gentlemen.
Ladies.
We must free Calypso.
[Clamoring] Shoot him.
Cut out his tongue!
Shoot him, cut out his tongue, then shoot his tongue.
And trim that beard.
Sao Feng would've agreed with Barbossa.
Calypso was our enemy then, she will be our enemy now.
It's unlikely her mood's improved.
I would still agree with Sao Feng.
We release Calypso.
You threaten me?
I silence you.
[All shouting] This is madness.
This is politics.
Meanwhile, our enemies are bearing down upon us.
If they not be here already.
[Shouting and gunfire in distance] [Shouting and gunfire in distance] [Music box playing] [Music box stops] [Another music box playing] My sweet.
You come for me.
You were expecting me.
It has been torture.
Trapped in this single form.
Cut off from the sea.
From all that I love.
From you.
Ten years I devoted to the duty you charged to me.
Ten years I looked after those who died at sea.
And, finally, when we could be together again... ...you werert there.
[Music box stops] Why werert you there?
Lt's my nature.
Would you love me if I was anything but what I am?
I do not love you.
Many things you were, Davy Jones.
But never cruel.
You have corrupted your purpose... ...and so your self.
And you did hide away what should always have been mine.
[Gasping] Calypso.
I will be free.
And when I am, I would give you my heart.
And we would be together always.
If only you had a heart to give.
Why did you come?
And what fate have you planned for your captors?
The Brethren Court?
All of them, the last thing they will learn in this life... ...is how cruel I can be.
And what of your fate, Davy Jones?
My heart will always belong to you.
[Shouting] [Glass breaking] Lt was the First Court what imprisoned Calypso.
We should be the ones to set her free.
And in her gratitude, she will see fit to grant us boons.
Whose boons?
Your boons?
Utterly deceptive twaddle-speak, says I.
If you have a better alternative, please, share.
Cuttlefish.
Aye.
Let us not, dear friends, forget our dear friends, the cuttlefish.
Flipping glorious little sausages.
Pen them up together, they'll devour each other without a second thought.
Human nature, isn't it?
Or... Or fish nature.
So, yes, we could hole up here well-provisioned and well-armed.
Half of us would be dead within the month.
Which seems quite grim to me, any way you slice it.
Or...
Uh... As my learned colleague so naively suggests, we can release Calypso, and we can pray that she will be merciful.
I rather doubt it.
Can we pretend she's anything other than a woman scorned like which fury hell hath no?
We cannot.
Res ipsa loquitur, tabula in naufragio.
We are left with but one option.
I agree with, and I cannot believe the words are coming out of me mouth... ...Captain Swann.
We must fight.
You've always run away from a fight.
Have not.
Have so.
Have not.
Have so.
Have not!
You have so, and you know it.
Have not.
Slander and calumny.
I have only ever embraced that oldest and noblest of pirate traditions.
I submit that here now that is what we all must do: We must fight... ...to run away.
Aye!
[All] Aye!
As per the code, an act of war, and this be exactly that, can only be declared by the pirate king.
You made that up.
Did I, now?
I call on Cap'n Teague, keeper of the code.
Sri Sumbhajee proclaims this all to be folly!
Hang the code.
Who cares a...?
[Gunshot] Code is the law.
You're in my way, boy.
The code.
The code.
As set forth by Morgan and Bartholomew.
[Whistles] That can't... How did... Sea turtles, mate.
[Barks] Sea turtles.
Ah.
Barbossa is right.
[Jack] Hang on a minute.
"Lt shall be the duties, as the king, to declare war, parley with shared adversaries..." Fancy that.
There has not been a king since the First Court.
And that's not likely to change.
Not likely.
Why not?
See, the pirate king is elected by popular vote.
And each pirate only ever votes for hisself.
I call for a vote.
[Murmuring] [Playing guitar] I vote for Ammand the corsair.
Capitaine Chevalle, the penniless Frenchman.
Sri Sumbhajee votes for Sri Sumbhajee.
Mistress Ching.
Gentleman Jocard.
Elizabeth Swann.
Barbossa.
Vallenueva!
Elizabeth Swann.
What?
I know.
Curious, isn't it?
Vote for me.
Vote for me.
What you talking about?
No!
Am I to understand that you lot will not be keeping to the code, then?
[String breaks] Very well.
What say you, Captain Swann, king of the Brethren Court?
Prepare every vessel that floats.
At dawn... ...we're at war.
[High-pitched] And so we shall go to war.
[All shouting] What?
You've seen it all, done it all.
You survived.
That's the trick, isn't it?
To survive?
Lt's not just about living forever, Jackie.
The trick is living with yourself forever.
How's Mum?
She looks great.
The enemy is here!
Let's take them!
[Shouting] [Shouting stops] [Parrot] Abandon ship.
Abandon ship.
Parley?
You be the cur that led these wolves to our door.
Don't blame Turner.
He was merely the tool of your betrayal.
If you wish to see its grand architect, look to your left.
My hands are clean in this.
Figuratively.
My actions were my own and to my own purpose.
Jack had nothing to do with it.
Well spoke.
Listen to the tool.
Will, I've been aboard the Dutchman.
I understand the burden you bear, but I fear that cause is lost.
No cause is lost if there is but one fool left to fight for it.
If Turner wasrt acting on your behalf, then how did he come to give me this?
You made a deal with me, Jack, to deliver the pirates.
And here they are.
Don't be bashful.
Step up.
Claim your reward.
[Jones] Your debt to me is still to be satisfied.
One hundred years in servitude aboard the Dutchman.
As a start.
That debt was paid, mate.
With some help.
[Jones] You escaped.
Technically.
I propose an exchange.
Will leaves with us... ...and you can take Jack.
Done.
Undone.
Done.
Jack's one of the nine pirate lords.
You have no right.
King.
As you command, your nibs.
Blackguard!
Lf ye have something to say, I might be saying something as well.
First to the finish, then?
Do you fear death?
You've no idea.
Advise your Brethren, you can fight, and all of you will die.
Or you can not fight, in which case only most of you will die.
You murdered my father.
He chose his own fate.
And you have chosen yours.
We will fight.
And you will die.
So be it.
[Will] King?
Of the Brethren Court.
Courtesy of Jack.
Maybe he really does know what he's doing.
Bravo!
You've successfully arrived aboard the Dutchman as per the overall scheme.
Look Oh, yes.
Chapeau, mate.
Except for this sojourn in the brig, it's utter clockwork.
Go away.
What, back to the Locker?
Not without you, Jackie.
Stab the heart.
Live forever as captain of the Flying Dutchman.
Then again... ...if you're in the brig... ...who's to stab the heart?
Does seem to put immortality a bit out of reach.
Peanut.
We'll need to use the Black Pearl as a flagship to lead the attack.
Oh, will we now?
All right, Mrs.
Fish.
Come on.
Barbossa, you can't release her.
We need to give Jack a chance.
Apologies, Your Majesty.
Too long my fate has not been in me own hands.
No longer.
The enemy... ...has opted for oblivion.
Ready the fleet.
To your stations.
[Man] To your stations.
Be there some manner of rite or incantation?
Aye.
The items brought together, done.
Items to be burned... ...and someone must speak the words: "Calypso, I release you from your human bonds."
Is that it?
'Tis said it must be spoken as if to a lover.
[All] Ooh!
Calypso, I release you from your human bonds!
Is that it?
No, no, no.
He didn't say it right.
He didn't... You have to say it right.
Calypso...
...I release you from your human bonds.
Tia Dalma.
Calypso.
When the Brethren Court imprisoned you, who was it that told them how?
Who was it that betrayed you?
Name him.
Davy Jones.
This is it!
This is it!
[Rope chafing] [Snapping] Calypso!
I come before you as but a servant, humble and contrite.
I have fulfilled me vow and now ask your favor.
Spare meself, me ship, me crew... ...but unleash your fury upon those who dare pretend themselves your masters... ...or mine.
[Yelling indistinct incantation] [Wincing] Is that it?
Why, she's no help at all.
What now?
Nothing.
Our final hope has failed us.
[Wind gusting] It's not over.
There's still a fight to be had.
We've an armada against us, and with the Dutchman, there's no chance.
There's only a fool's chance.
Revenge won't bring your father back, Miss Swann, and it's not something I'm intending to die for.
You're right.
Then what shall we die for?
You will listen to me.
Listen!
The Brethren will still be looking here to us, to the Black Pearl, to lead.
And what will they see?
Frightened bilge rats aboard a derelict ship?
No.
No, they will see free men and freedom!
And what the enemy will see is the flash of our cannons.
They will hear the ring of our swords, and they will know what we can do.
By the sweat of our brows, and the strength of our backs... ...and the courage of our hearts.
Gentlemen... ...hoist the colors.
Hoist the colors.
Hoist the colors.
Hoist the colors!
Aye.
The wind's on our side, boys.
That's all we need!
[Shouting] Hoist the colors!
[Shouting in Chinese] We have a favorable wind, sir.
Oh, so we do.
Signal Jones to give no quarter.
That should brighten his day.
To arms!
We give no quarter!
Calypso.
[Thunder rumbling] [Screeching] Have you noticed, on top of everything, it's raining?
That's a bad sign.
Man the capstan.
Raise the main topyard.
Keep that powder dry.
[Thunderclap] Maelstrom!
[Elizabeth] Captain Barbossa!
We need you at the helm.
Aye, that be true.
Brace up yards, you cack-handed deck apes.
Dying is the day won'th living for.
Veer off!
She'll not harm us.
Full-bore and into the abyss.
Are you mad?
Ha!
You afraid to get wet?
She's on our stern and gaining.
More speed!
Haul your wind and hold your water.
Bow cannons!
[Man] Blow the cannons!
Take us out or they'll overbear us.
Nay.
Further in.
We'll cut across to faster waters.
Prepare to broadside.
Captain the guns.
Bear a hand.
Muster your courage, men.
At the ready.
Think like the whelp.
Think like the whelp.
Think like the whelp.
Hinges.
Hinges.
Think like the whelp.
Half-barrel hinges.
Leverage.
Wish us luck, boys.
We'll need it.
I miss him already.
He is quite charming, isn't he?
Nobody move.
I dropped me brain.
[Thunderclap] Batten down the hatches!
Stand to your guns.
Midship cannoneers, sight the masts.
Main battery at the ready!
Hold there!
Wait till we're board-and-board.
Fire!
Fire!
Fire!
Fire all!
Fire!
Fire!
Come on, men.
It be too late to alter course now, mateys.
Halt there or we'll shoot.
Good one.
I just come to get me effects.
Admirable though it may be, why are you here when you could be elsewhere?
Someone has to stay and guard the chest.
There's no question, there's a breakdown in military discipline on this vessel.
I blame the fish people.
Oh, so fish people, by dint of being fish people, automatically aren't as disciplined as non-fish people?
Seems contributory, is all I'm suggesting.
It's true, if there were no fish people, there'd be no need to guard the chest.
And if there were no chest we wouldn't need to be here to guard it.
[Men shouting] Prepare to board!
Cover!
[Groaning] [Grunts] No!
[Chuckles] [Jones chuckles] Lookee here, boys.
A lost bird.
A lost bird that never learned to fly.
To my great regret.
But... ...never too late to learn, eh?
[Screaming] Whoa!
The chest, hand it over.
I can set you free, mate.
My freedOm WaS fOrfeit IOng agO.
Elizabeth.
Elizabeth.
Will you marry me?
I don't think now's the best time.
Now may be the only time.
I love you.
I've made my choice.
What's yours?
Barbossa.
Marry us.
I'm a little busy at the moment.
Barbossa, now.
Fine, then.
Dearly beloved, we be gathered here today... To nail your gizzards to the mast, you poxy cur.
Elizabeth Swann, do you take me to be your husband?
I do.
Great.
Will Turner, do you take me... ...to be your wife... ...in sickness and in health... ...with health being the less likely?
I do.
As captain, I now pronounce you... You may kiss... [cackles] You may kiss... Just kiss.
[Monkey screeches] Leave it.
You can do nothing without the key.
I already have the key.
No, you don't.
Oh, that key.
No!
Oi.
My pistol.
[Screams] Turner.
Fire!
[Muffled grunting] Thank you, Jack.
Stop!
Lt's me.
It's Will.
Your son.
Ha!
[Screams] [Thud] [Both grunt] Go!
Harridan!
You'll see no mercy from me.
That's why I brought this.
[Elizabeth grunting] I'm not going to kill you.
I made you a promise.
[Yells] Missed.
Did you forget?
I'm a heartless wretch.
Ah.
Love.
A dreadful bond.
And yet, so easily severed.
Tell me, William Turner, do you fear death?
[Jack] Do you?
[Heart beating] Heady tonic, holding life and death in the palm of one's hand.
You're a cruel man, Jack Sparrow.
Cruel is a matter of perspective.
Is it?
[Groans] [Gasps] Will?
Look at me!
Stay with me!
You're all right.
William?
My son.
Will?
Will?
Look at me.
Look at me!
You will not forestall my judgment.
[Gasping] Calypso.
She's taking us down!
Make quick or it's the Locker for us all!
No.
No, no.
No!
[All] Part of the crew.
Part of the ship, part of the crew.
Part of the ship, part of the crew.
Don't leave me.
Don't.
No!
I won't leave you.
The Dutchman must have a captain.
Hold on.
Thank goodness, Jack.
The armada's still out there.
The Endeavor's coming up hard to starboard, and I think it's time we embrace that oldest and noblest of pirate traditions.
Never actually been one for tradition.
Close haul her.
Luff the sails and lay her in irons.
Belay that, or we'll be a sitting duck.
Belay that "belay that."
But the arma... Belay.
The Endeav... Stow.
Shut it.
What are they waiting for?
He expects us to honor our agreement.
[Man] Ready guns and gun ports.
It's nothing personal, Jack.
It's just good business.
Ah, she survived.
[Grunting and moaning] Ready on the guns.
[All] Guns ready.
Full canvas.
Aye, full canvas.
Orders, sir.
Sir!
Cap'n.
Fire.
Fire!
Fire!
Fire!
Fire, all!
Orders?
Orders, sir?
Sir, what do you command?
Lt's just... ...good business.
Abandon ship!
Abandon ship!
All hands, abandon ship!
[Glass shatters] [Explosions] They're turning away!
[Shouting] [Squawks] Wind in your sails.
Shiver me timbers.
[Shouting, cheering] Captain Turner!
Mr. Gibbs.
Cap'n?
You may throw my hat if you like.
Aye, aye, cap'n.
Hooray!
Now go and get it.
Orders, sir?
You're no longer bound to the Dutchman.
You're free.
Aye.
That's a fine thing, but... ...by my reckoning, I still have a debt that has to be paid.
If you'll have me.
On the wheel, then, Mr. Turner.
Aye, Captain Turner.
[Bootstrap Bill] This ship has a purpose again.
And where we are bound... ...she cannot come.
One day ashore.
Ten years at sea.
That's a steep price for what's been done.
Depends on the one day.
Your chariot awaits, Your Highness.
The oars are inside.
Mrs. Turner.
Goodbye, poppet.
Jack.
It would never have worked out between us.
Keep telling yourself that, darling.
Once was quite enough.
Thank you.
I'm going to need the other one.
It's nearly sunset.
[Heart beating] Lt's always belonged to you.
Will you keep it safe?
Yes.
Yes.
Will!
Keep a weather eye on the horizon.
Granted it tends to list to port, and has been, on occasion, known to frighten young women.
But I promise you, you will not be disappointed.
Is that it?
The Black Pearl.
It's not very big.
Love, that is a dinghy.
My vessel is magnificent and fierce and huge-ish and... ...gone.
Why is it gone?
Is that it there?
Yes, there it is.
Why is it there?
Lt's much larger up close.
[Sighs] Jack, you promised to take us for a ride.
I was to be given the first ride.
What?
You?
Not what he said.
[Gasps] I never!
Mr. Gibbs?
Any particular reason why my ship is gone?
The ship?
We're on the ship.
Jack!
The ship's gone!
Really?
Ladies!
Will you please shut it?
Listen to me.
Yes, I lied to you.
No, I don't love you.
Of course it makes you look fat.
I've never been to Brussels.
It is pronounced "egregious."
By the way, no, I've never actually met Pizarro, but I love his pies.
And all of this pales to utter insignificance in light of the fact that my ship is once again gone.
Savvy?
Take what you can.
Give nothing back.
Tell me, ladies, what do you know of sea turtles?
Sea turtles?
Let me tell you the amazing story of Cap... [Barbossa] All men up the ratlines.
All men up the ratlines!
Oh, you want a taste of this?
Oh, that's a good boy!
You're Daddy's boy.
Oh, yes, you are.
Oh, yes, you are.
Sir?
Some of the men don't feel entirely settled about leaving Captain Jack behind.
Again.
Again.
Is that so?
Lt would make us feel a whole lot better regarding our fortunes if we could see that item you told us about.
On the charts.
Aye.
With our own eyes.
To help put an ease to our burden of guilt, so to speak.
Ah.
Feast your eyes upon this, mateys.
There's more than one way to live forever.
Gents, I give you the Fountain of Youth.
Sparrow.
[Jack] # Yo ho, yo ho A pirate's life for me [humming] # We're devils and black sheep Really bad eggs # Drink up, me hearties Yo ho [boy] # Yo ho, yo ho A pirate's life for me # We pillage, we plunder We rifle and loot # Drink up, me hearties Yo ho # We kidnap and ravage And don't give a hoot # Drink up, me hearties Yo ho # Yo ho, yo ho A pirate's life for me #
The captain wants to see you on the deck, Silver.
You want a hand up?
No.
Look at me.
Is the captain dancing so?
How much?
So we go to the island tomorrow.
Yes, I do.
Bank the deposit.
I do.
You're gonna What?
This is it now, Silver.
These days are done.
You're disbanding the crew?
No.
I'm going to kill the crew.
There's a jolly boat down in the water.
Get the men in there, take your chances.
Put your muzzles up, Billy Bones.
I said, go down or you will be blown down.
That treasure you're taking, Captain, ain't yours to steal it.
He's getting his words in a twist but there's truth there.
Silver.
We've all shared the thieving.
And the dying.
I am the law on this ship.
And I'm sharing with none.
Now, I tot things up.
I know, cos it's tattooed on my brain which each man here is entitled to.
Let's disband if that's what's due.
But let us all have the lives we have earned, Flint.
Let us share in... You talk too much, John Silver.
Get to the jolly boat!
Get off this ship.
Help Pew!
I don't know how, Mr Silver.
I can't see!
A blade!
Give me a blade1 Give me a blade!
My condolences on William's death.
Thank you, Dr Livesey.
Your husband was a good man.
A good friend.
Jim.
Sir.
You'll need to step up now.
For your mother.
If there's anything you need or I can do professionally or as your father's friend...
The inn is open, so...
I expect we'll be seeing you.
..then call on me.
Yes, Jim?
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum.
Drink and the devil had done for the rest.
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum.
We're not open today, sir.
Let's have the rum, boy.
Let's be having it.
The boy told you, we're not open.
Having it now.
Of course, sir.
This is a handy cove, this place.
I want to speak to the man here.
I'm the man here.
You get much company?
Just locals.
Bristol traffic stays to the High Road.
Then this will be me then.
We don't do rooms.
Yes, we do.
We do.
Jim.
If you're paying.
Oh, I'm paying.
Yeah, I'm paying.
The room, the bacon and the eggs is all I want.
What do we call you then, sir?
You can call me the captain.
That's what you say.
This is the room, sir.
I need you to do something for me, Jimmy.
What?
I want to know the minute any seafaring man comes down that track.
And one of these will be yours.
Each week.
No seafaring men.
And keep the grog coming, let's keep these horrors away.
Set with me, my captain.
Are you Captain Flint?
Captain.
Served with Captain Flint, I did.
He was my man of honour, Jim.
Biggest dog in the sea.
He would bite your legs off, Jimmy.
He would bite your fingers off to get in your rings.
And he was my captain.
Flint would line up the officers, he would bind them tight, chain cannonballs to their feet, throw them over the side to see if they floated.
But he had honour now.
Yes.
He was not of bitterness.
Send him off on the big wide in little jolly boats.
Letting them take the chances.
It was mercy, was it?
You want another one, Doctor?
No, no.
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of the rum.
Drink and the Devil and had done for the rest.
He's a bit of life, isn't he?
He drinks us dry.
If only he'd start paying.
And Cookey's throat was marked belike.
How are you?
It's a struggle, Doctor, as you know.
Here's some for what he owes.
No.
Meg.
And there they lay and the soggy skies.
Dripped all day long in unstaring eyes.
In murk upset and foul surprise!
Is that my mate Billy's?
Don't go near the bucket.
It's evil.
Jimmy!
Eggs and bacon, Jim!
I want my breakfast.
The eggs and the bacon, Jim.
Bill.
Black Dog.
I'm not here to fight, I'm here to talk.
Talk to my old ship mate.
About the good times and the thieving.
And about our old Captain.
Them eggs and bacon sounded good to me too.
Pleased to see me... living?
Our luck was in.
Six days rowing and we got picked up by a merchant men.
Friendly fella.
I heard it.
Yeah, well, I hear things too, Billy.
I've heard from many a mouth the old man's dead, truth in that?
Truth enough.
And that he's old sick corpse was not surrounded by any sign of his ill-gotten wealth, truth in that?
What happened after Flint drifted us loyal boys on the sea?
I leave this gap in our talk for you to fill it.
If you don't, I know seafaring men in Bristol that have been waiting three years for you.
And will pay me grand if I tell where you are.
Went to the island.
'Made our deposit.'
Their spirits can stand guard a while.
Took his saddle of coin to Carolina.
Dreamt of buying some land.
Plantation.
Flint didn't trust no-one.
He knew it was safe.
Sleeping quietly.
'No-one could find it without his map.'
Where's my treasure?
Where is it, Billy?
I'll haunt him who takes it.
Get the doctor!
I'll haunt him to his grave.
I'll drag him, drag him down with me.
Where's the map?
The map?
Where is it?
Lost, I don't know.
Where's Flint's map?
Died with him, I don't know.
Ask me that once more, I'll stick a blade in you.
What's the plan, Billy?
You in Bristol to get a ship to get back there, hmm?
You?
A man who needs an order from his captain to tell him when to buckle his boot in the morning.
As soon as you open that mouth outside these walls, you will be found, Billy Bones.
And that quartermaster and his boys will end your days.
But they'll never know you washed up here... ..if you give me the map.
Come back, I will kill you!
I said no seafaring men!
I'm sorry, Captain.
Any seafaring men, you come and tell me!
Don't you hurt my boy!
I want you out of here.
Pay what you owe!
I want you out of here.
So.
You're at Billy's Beck and you don't tell Long John first.
It's a wonder you're not sitting here with a new grin on your neck.
From ear to ear.
Pew.
Let's do this right.
Help.
Is there anyone?
Would any kind friend inform a blind old man who lost his precious sight in the gracious defence of his majesty, King George.
Where or in what part of the country may now be?
This is the Admiral Benbow.
Black Hill Cove.
Oh, is it now?
Oh, is it?
Would the owner of that young voice come kindly here?
Would he help this old soldier?
Would he let me take his hand, would he do that out of the kindness of his heart?
And guide me inside?
My mother will find you some food.
But we don't have much.
Thank you.
Thank you kindly, young man.
Billy Bones now or I'll break this arm.
Sir, he sits with his cutlass, sir.
Now, when I come into view, you say, "Here's another friend for you, Bill."
Now you do it.
Here's another friend for you, Bill.
Stay where you are, Bill.
I can't see or hear a finger stirring.
Pew.
And business is business.
Now take his hand.
And bring it to me, boy.
There.
The Black Spot is done.
They're coming for me, Jim.
They're coming.
What's the writing on it?
Hmm?
Tonight.
They're coming for me, Jim.
It comes.
There will be money in his chest.
They're gonna come back.
I will watch you.
They'll come back and kill us if we find us thieving the chest.
Not thieving.
We need help.
They'll be cut throats.
Come on.
Doctor!
Doctor!
Flint's crew are coming to the Admiral Benbow?
We need that money or we'll be done for.
Yes, yes.
Let me just... Come on.
No.
I'll saddle them right for their revenues.
I hear they've been patrolling in Kitt's Cove.
No, we need you to come now!
Let me ride for the men.
The revenue's men, Jim will help.
Jim, Jim.
Use this if you have to.
I'm going to get the revenue's men.
Is that you I hear?
It is, Pew.
Good.
Come on, lads, step on it.
I should be hearing more feet.
He's coming.
He'll have a key on him.
Where is it?
His shirt.
Look.
There.
Bones, we've come early for you, Bill.
It's all the boys you sent drifting.
Mum!
This is not our English coin, Jim.
Move it, Pew!
Where is he?
Something on the floor.
He's dead, Pew.
Check the chest then.
Take anything!
Get up them stairs!
Who is it?
Somebody's rifled through it.
It's that boy has stolen it.
That boy and that woman.
He's legged it!
Then search for them!
And you find them and kill them.
Jim.
They'll be near.
Find her!
Take the money and run.
No, please.
Come on.
That's it, reports are coming.
I've got you now!
I have the boy here!
Are you the boy?!
Over there, hunt him down!
Are you safe?
Is your mother safe?
Jim.
We're fine.
Your mother's going to sleep upstairs.
You can sleep here.
You still miss her, Doctor?
Two years, Jim, now.
And the baby.
What's that?
I think it's what Flint's crew were after.
"12th June 1745, off Caracas."
7,000.
You see here, this is latitude and longitude.
It's like an account book.
That's exactly it.
It's Flint's tally of the ships he's taken.
The money here, 3,000 here, 10,000.
Let me see.
These markings.
Doctor, I heard Bones tell that Black Dog Flint had hidden his treasure and made a map.
This is Flint's map?
It has to be.
This is Flint here?
Oh, Jim.
Oh, no, Jim.
This is fortune.
I must collect myself.
If this book is what is buried here, there must be more money than men like us, men like your father would see in an eternity.
My mother would want for nothing.
No.
We would all be free.
All of us, free of these lives we lead.
Free to be as... gentlemen.
Will we go?
We must go.
Have you sailed?
No, but I have maps of the seas, I have knowledge of how the world works.
And the world works best when there is a plan.
I will plan a venture, Jim Hawkins, and we will both profit wildly.
Trust me, boy.
This is genuine?
Yes.
My proposition, Squire Trelawney, is that I'll hire a sea captain, Jim and I, crew a schooner out of Bristol, equip it for the purpose of excavation.
And set out on an expedition for this island which I believe to be here, just here.
In the West Indies.
For which a request capital of 1,000.
The return on which I guarantee... at 500%.
Not a punt, sir, guarantee.
I'm equipped to lead the expedition for I served as medical officer with the Duke of Cumberland at Fontenoy.
How much are you expecting to find on Captain Flint's island?
We don't want to say, sir.
Young Mr Hawkins, whose father was always in arrears on the Benbow.
He borrowed money from me also, isn't that not so?
That is so.
300,000.
I know of a sea captain called Smollett, sir, who's of the highest reputation.
Having served under Admiral Hawke before he came a merchantman.
Get him to Bristol as soon as you can.
I'll be taking rooms at the George.
Good news, I will be financing the venture.
And I will be commanding it myself, I hope that's agreeable?
It's most agreeable.
Hunter and Joyce are coming to Bristol, aren't you, lads?
Yes, sir.
And will help crew the ship I go to purchase because haste is of the essence.
Absolutely.
You will govern as the medical man on the ship.
Yes.
And we will need a ship's boy.
You still want the adventure of a lifetime, young man?
Yes, Squire.
Then the berth is yours.
Be in Bristol by the end of next week.
When your father was away, he would say, "Look at the moon, Meg."
"Look at it every night and know that wherever I am in the world, I'll be looking at it too."
Must go, Jim.
Dr Livesey thinks we'll be three months.
Fresh fish!
This way.
Stay close, Jim.
Come on, sir.
Whatever takes your fancy.
Fresh banana.
Doctor?
Doctor?
Doctor?
Doctor?
You're alright, lad.
Quite a tumble, that, eh?
Come on.
Sorry.
You looking for your berth?
I am.
What's she called?
The Hispaniola.
The Hispaniola, eh?
How about I give you a hand trying to find her?
Thank you, sir.
Hispaniola.
Squire Trelawney.
There you are, Jim.
Come on board, Hawkins.
Is this our ship?
She is.
My Hispaniola, bought and fitted.
The Squire was saying you could sail her tomorrow were the service of a crew as simple to secure as the ship itself.
Captain Smollett comes from Plymouth with the haste of the snail.
He thinks we're a dozen short.
I say she's a lovely ship.
Well chosen.
Thank you.
She's got arse on her that would sit well on any sea.
I always say a man who can choose a good horse could choose a good ship just by looking at its arse.
And you, sir, look like a man who knows his way around a horse's ass.
Yes, I do.
Might I ask how long is the passing?
Three months.
To whom am I speaking?
John Silver, sir.
John Silver to you all.
Young man.
Mr Silver.
May I enquire if you have nailed the service of a cook, a sea cook being what I am.
I heard talk round about you're scouting for a crew.
No, but Mr Silver... You don't need to go pointing out at the lack of a peg, sir.
You cooks with your fingers and your thumbs.
Not with your toes.
Don't you, boy?
I serve dishes down at the Spyglass.
You won't get any niggle there about the food.
Have you sailed, Mr Silver?
Since I was a lad.
Boat shipman.
Your first passing, son?
It is.
You're lucky to be part of such a ship.
If you're serious, come on board and let the first mate show you the galley and we can talk terms.
You shouldn't talk terms with a cook without first tasting his food.
Like marrying a girl before seeing how her mother's turned out.
When you're ready, why don't you can down the Spyglass.
Find the food tasty, then we should talk terms.
Until then, good day to you.
Good day, Mr Silver.
Jim.
Sir.
Another bottle of this, thank you.
Now, you honour, been thinking about your situation and if I may be so bold...
This is excellent, Silver.
If I might be so bold as to act as recruiting sergeant, I feel I could crew your ship by the weekend.
Allright, then do it.
With who?
A ship came in from the Indies not six days ago.
I know the men.
Used to have the berth.
I also know in a couple of days' time they will be penniless.
Due to the... pleasures of the port.
The first mate goes by the name of George Merry.
I've employed a first mate, his name is Arrow.
They come with the first mate, keeps them tight.
Are you telling me my business or are you cooking me my food?
Cooking your food.
If you can, bring them along by the weekend.
No, first thing in the morning.
We've no time to waste.
Been them along first thing.
First thing.
First thing, your honour.
Alright, Jim.
Clear the officers' plates.
Yes, sir.
Delicious.
I like the new boy.
He's a good working lad, my sweet.
You and me, Jim.
We'll keep their bellies full on this voyage, won't we?
Sorry.
Black Dog.
Black Dog, that's one of Flint's crew.
After him, lads!
Look lively.
Squire Trelawney, that was one of Flint's crew.
I saw him fight with Billy Bones.
One of them Buccaneers in my house?
The landlord will have me out for this.
He won't stand scum in here.
Sit yourselves down, I'll get you an extra bottle.
Ran away, John.
Fast as a whippet.
Fruit, in the hull now!
In the forecastle deck.
Let's get this moving!
Or we won't catch the evening tide!
Get that gentlemen off the gangplank, it's a working ship!
I am its captain.
Sir.
What's your name, first mate?
Arrow, sir.
Where do you want the pay, sir?
Pen it on the deck.
Is Squire Trelawney on board?
At church, Captain.
Why do you have to go?
Why?
Because this voyage is everything.
It's everything, my love.
After this we'll be ground people.
Carriages and frock coats.
Our own pew in church near the front where the action is.
Nobody's cook.
Nobody's tart.
Can you just imagine the grand house we're gonna live in?
You wouldn't look good in a wig.
Well, I'd like to try it.
That I would, my love.
With you away, what if something happened to me?
Been to the bank.
This is everything we've got.
I don't trust those banking crooks so while I'm away, stuff it safe.
You'll be alright.
Men come sniffing, get out of Bristol.
I don't know anywhere safe.
Black Hill Cove on the West Road.
The boy's mother runs the inn alone.
You go stay there.
It's as good as place as any.
What if the boy returns?
The boy ain't going to return.
Not a chance.
Him and that ship are never gonna see Bristol again.
Captain Smollett.
I have been engaged on sealed orders.
That's right.
To sail this ship for you, sir.
Where you should bid me that I accept.
What I don't in not using my own hands.
My time is my money, Smollett.
Captain Smollett.
And you were not prompt.
What I don't accept is learning from the hands my schedule for departure.
We are shipshape and sea-worthy we sail tonight.
You are not the captain.
My father served 20 years as an officer in his Majesty's Navy.
You're not your father however you dress up.
I am captain of the Hispaniola with full authority over every man on board.
I will not learn my orders from the crew a not accept a sealed order commission only to hear gossip from the men of our purpose.
What did they say?
They say treasure, sir.
They say the Caribbean Sea.
How do they know it?
Black Dog saw me, sir.
Word will be about.
That's why we sail tonight, Captain.
If this talk is sure where we go, we are not safe here in Bristol.
I don't like the stink of this.
I cannot sail without you.
I don't like the haste or the secret.
Good day, sir.
I'll double your money.
As we stand here.
Tell me what men you've brought with you.
Richard Joyce and John Hunter, both good Christian men.
A doctor.
Very well, make a garrison of the stern.
You do not trust the men?
I don't know the men.
Remove the powder in the arms from the forehold, keep a small store in this room until I know the cut of my crew.
We keep a watch at all times.
Friend.
Are there no pipes to pipe old John on board, lads ?
Not yet.
What's this, George?
Why is powder being stored?
By orders of Captain Smollett.
Oh, aye?
Mr Merry, if you will.
What?
If you want a chat, get yourself a dress, get down to the assembly room, that's where all the women go.
What?
You scum, I'll slit you.
George.
Mr Arrow, is it not?
John Silver, the sea cook.
Any more trouble, I tell you, you not leave port, you understand?
No trouble, Mr Arrow.
Just welcoming his old shipmate Johnny on board.
Meant nothing but respect and jollity, didn't you, George?
Trouble, Mr Arrow?
Just checking where we stand.
Or when one of us stands, the other one is lying on his back.
Just teething, Captain.
Just teething.
Get down below, Barbecue, the men will need feeding.
Barbecue.
Alright, captain.
Come on, Jim, help old Barbecue with his potatoes.
Don't worry about Mr Merry.
I've seen fist fighting.
I've seen my daddy break up worse than that.
Then you'll know, big dogs always go for each other on the first day.
Calms down after that.
I know that.
Yeah, George Merry will wear his nose like a badge of honour.
Badge of honour.
Why do you call him Flint?
Because this birdy is the biggest thieving parrot who's ever sailed the seven seas.
Old Flint has got a lady parrot in every port.
Maybe like you, one day, lad.
Because you and I, we're gonna be thick on this voyage, I can tell.
You're as smart as paint.
Remind me of myself.
That's a high compliment coming from me.
Now you and I have got to make sure this crew is in a happy place.
First thing for a sea cook to do, is to make sure his officers are happy.
Why don't you get this to Squire Trelawney?
Sir, the doctor and I are partners with the Squire on this venture.
What exactly is this venture?
I do hear talk of sealed orders.
Just if things come as we hope, I'd like to say there would be extra for you, Mr Silver.
Thank you kindly, young sir.
Old John could sure do with a little lift.
So, why don't you take this settler along to your partner?
Yes, sir.
Almighty God, protect me and my ship in the vagaries of the sea.
From the capriciousness of the wind.
Grant your servant the wisdom of command.
Come in.
A settler from Mr Silver.
Yes, set it down.
Do you know when we'll be leaving port?
Very soon.
If Captain Smollett is to catch the tide.
Haul her in!
All hands to decks!
All hands!
Hoist the mainsail, Mr Arrow.
Hoist the mainsail, Mr Dujon.
Hoist the mainsail!
Finally leaving for it, Jim.
# I dreamed a dream # I dreamed a dream the other night # Lowlands, lowlands away, my John # I dreamed a dream # I dreamed a dream the other night # Lowlands, lowland away, my John # My love she came, she came all dressed in white # Lowlands, lowlands away, my John # My love she came to me, She came all dressed in white # Lowlands, lowlands away, my John West by south west.
West by south west, sir.
Alright, lads?
Grubs up.
He plundered five ships off Bermuda.
The old goat would hide in the mist, it would.
And then emerge like a ghost.
I heard he could appear and disappear at whim.
Like your mate's coinage here.
What you got, mate?
That's unlucky.
I heard when Flint took merchantmen, he'd put the survivors in jolly boats.
Right out on the big wide.
And he watched as they starve to death.
Yeah, I heard that too.
So, you fancy playing cards with old Israel, do you, Master Hawkins?
Can I leave your pockets?
If you want.
I don't believe them stories that Flint is dead.
Oh, he's dead for sure, Mr Arrow.
Yeah, died skint in a Yankee brothel.
I heard they took his body out to sea and dumped it, now it's in the belly of a million fishes.
And how do you know?
Well, I caught a fish the other day and it tasted of cigars.
You're in trouble, Israel.
Deep trouble.
Oh, Mr Dujon.
Sorry, lad.
You cheated old Israel!
I'll slit your throat, lad!
Israel.
Takes a shark to know a shark, now let him down easy.
Get out of here, Jim.
On your way.
So where's the grog, hmm?
Captain's rations, Mr Arrow.
So this is where we keep the rum for the officers.
Then this is where I keeps the key.
Being first mate, you can come and go.
Store them it daily.
Yeah.
One look at that Squire and he was gonna be cheap.
All haste and profit.
They were leaving port before we was fit.
That a true word.
I know people who've sailed this old tug.
They said she needed a refit before she went again.
Thank you, Long John.
Mr Arrow wants eyes on the crew.
He'll put in a good word for you with the Captain if you keep watch on George Merry and his hands for us.
Report to us, Silver.
Mr Dujon.
You are done, Mr Silver.
If you don't make your mark as a sea cook, you could always try a barber's surgeon.
Nearly there, Jim.
Thanks, Joe.
I ain't gonna look at that scum one more night, John.
I swear I'm gonna kill him.
There will be a time, George.
Time for all that.
Look, this Smollett is a good seaman, he'll get us to the island, we'll be bladed up and pistol primed by then.
With knowledge of the map and that is when we'll pounce.
In the meantime, we'll bring all the crew over to our side.
Those who stay loyal to the officers... ..we'll kill them.
"Marvellous things did he in the s-sight of their f-fathers."
"In the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan."
"He divided the sea and caused them to pass...
..through."
"He made the waters to stand as an heap."
Stewed cabbage to go with the pork belly.
Apple sauce.
The doctor fought at Fontenoy, Captain.
Really?
With the 23rd Foot.
As did my friend Lieutenant Gascoigne.
Who did not have a high opinion of our doctor.
I don't think I knew Lieutenant Gascoigne.
Well, he knew you.
And knew what words to use to describe your bravery in the face of the enemy, Dr Livesey.
No man knows how he'll be till he looks a Frenchie or a Spaniard in the face.
Eh, Doctor?
I know many a man who's bravery...
Shut up, Silver.
Squire Trelawney, whatever you've heard about previous incidents, I assure you on our business venture...
I'll feed the men, sir.
I think we need to clarify the term "our business venture."
Tell me, Livesey, what were you hoping to put up to secure the loan?
What do you own with a guaranteed worth of 5,000?
No.
You will earn a good wage as the medical man.
The boy is budgeted for a wage too.
I hope this clarifies any misunderstanding.
Yes.
Jimmy.
No, don't go down.
Stand up, stand up.
Lying down doesn't work.
Look at the horizon.
Keep your head at least moving.
So did that rich man, did he cut you out the profit of the voyage?
He did.
Your doctor, he made an argument for you, didn't he?
Tell me he did.
Now, there's talk, Jim, below decks and I'm hearing of a map your Squire has, shows our port of call.
A map?
Cos I'd love to see it, for my journal.
My own ship's log.
Get the bearings, cos no-one knows where we're heading.
You've seen it?
Don't know.
Because the rumour is the map was yours too.
You've not seen it?
I don't know.
Would be a large piece of paper and will look like a map.
What's that?
Ginger.
Chewing it's a trick for your tum.
Go on.
Try and get some sleep.
What is it?
Just looking for some food, missus, that's all.
Are you paying, girl?
I'm paying.
Some eggs I see there.
A drink if that's acceptable, missus?
Are you in trouble, girl?
Where are you going?
Just staying off the Bristol Road.
What kind of trouble are you in?
There is gold for all loyal boys on that island.
All you need.
And you have my word that those that follow my orders when I spring the trap will get their due.
So are you with me, lads?
Are you cooking for Silver now, boy?
I'm sorry.
Then sundown to the horizon.
And when it's lower limb is touching that.
Dujon.
To the top, see to that.
Tool to the tops!
The sun is no longer rising, you got that?
Yes, Captain.
To the tops!
We work out the latitude and begin to place ourselves here on the map.
It's not dreams that fix stars that govern life.
They're always there for you.
Have faith in what is constant out there.
Dr Livesey.
Mr Dujon.
He's dead, Captain.
What happened, man?
He fell from the top sail.
The rattlings up there are rotten.
Go see.
I saw him fall.
I saw him grapping and falling up there.
Mr Arrow.
You ran checks on the main topmast before we sailed?
Mr Dujon.
It just gave way.
I was stretching my neck and I watched him, eager to get down the length of the yard and it gave way under him.
Boys have complained about it before.
Not to me.
Mr Arrow knew it, sir.
There's a feeling below deck that... What?
It's not my place to talk.
Below deck, we said we left port before we was right.
Got it.
There can only be one outcome, Captain Smollett.
It's preposterous.
No, it is not.
As captain of this ship, I shoulder the blame.
I apologise, men.
Below deck, we feel say that haste and profit are the officers on this ship, sir.
And are valued by some more than they value men's lives.
Withdraw that.
Make him withdraw that.
Accidents are life, gentlemen.
It is clear that Dujon's negligence contributed to his own death.
It was no negligence.
That's enough.
Give the man a Christian burial.
Put deep to his maker.
The sooner we get to where we're heading, then good for all.
Be in that mist in an hour.
It's real thick, Joe.
Remember these are Flint's waters.
And this is what Flint would do, boys.
He would wait for the ship in mist to hit.
Then it would come for it.
You got any children, Israel?
One or two, John.
Don't go telling them bedtime stories, whatever you do.
All hands west ship!
One of the privateers from the Americas?
We don't have the speed to out-run anything.
Kill all the lanterns.
Kill all the noise.
These are the Captain's waters, John Silver.
Did you see that?
He's back from the dead, John.
There ain't no thing as spirits.
Flint dead will be more evil than when he was alive.
I told you, that's the old man's spirit.
There ain't no thing as spirits.
What you call that then, Silver?
That route would take an extra four days.
If we cut through Bermuda waters, we'll reach our destination by Friday.
To sail without convoy is dangerous.
There are pirates near Bermuda who wait for such prizes as us.
I've read of privateers, under commission from American colonies to clean up these waters but act no better than Flint himself.
Enough of this!
your orders are to follow a direct route.
The crew are seasoned seafarers.
They know the trouble in these waters, they will not sail in them.
I believe they can be persuaded, sir.
Good man.
I believe if we're primed and ready for an attack, the boys I vouch for will take the direct route.
The others will come along.
I feel almost sure of it, sir.
Good man, Silver.
Blade up, boys!
Check the pistols and the powder.
Gun crews primed and practice on the gun deck.
Where's Mr Arrow?
Below deck was up incapacitated.
Did you give him liquor?
No.
Where did he get it from?
Mr Merry, you'll be my first mate now until further orders.
Aye, sir.
Load them up, boys.
Fire!
What course, sir?
West by south west.
West by south west, sir.
Fire!
How much longer will we need to stand here?
Oh, a day, couple of days.
Depends on our port of call.
But now would be a very good time for that map to walk out the Squire's cabin, come down here, walk in to the galley, walk past my eyeballs.
What do you think, Jim Hawkins?
Hawkins.
Yeah.
Now would be a very good time.
We should get Mr Arrow below before the captain sees.
Mr Silver said not.
He said he was like an untethered dog.
Drinking comfort like a friend.
It's where weakness goes.
Down a man's throat.
What is this?
Is this the original?
No.
The one I saw had more markings on the island.
Squire Trelawney must have made a fresh copy.
I want to trace the original, not this.
But everything's there, latitude, longitude.
For your journal.
Well, better put it back now.
Good lad.
We could go now, John.
On my word.
Which you won't be getting yet.
Because we haven't seen the map yet.
If we got that, I reckon your word would come tumbling out.
Patience, boys.
Patience.
Alright, here it goes.
Think of the lives you're gonna live if you follow my orders now.
You'll never have to follow orders again.
Squire Trelawney!
Think of the happiness this treasure will bring you.
The wives you're gonna have.
Though none as good as mine.
Trelawney!
Mr Merry, escort this gentleman below and put him in irons.
You killed him.
Get below as the Captain says.
You killed David.
I kill you!
I know many of you have served in his Majesty's Navy.
As did my father.
From whom I have learned many things about the service.
Its beauty.
Its danger.
And its discipline.
Which must be insisted upon.
For the crime of the attempted murder of a gentleman, Mr Arrow is to be disciplined.
Take the body down below.
Make the right decision.
You're a good lad.
Mr Silver?
Smart as paint is what you are.
Mr Silver.
I can tell you're a good lad.
Smart as paint, you remind of myself.
That's a high compliment coming from me.
Now you know we're Flint's old crew.
When the tide is right, we're gonna take this ship and the treasure on that island which is ours by right.
I heard that talk, Mr silver.
So will you be with us?
Yes.
I'll be with you, Mr Silver.
Smart lad.
Is he with us?
He says it but we'll see.
I'm with you, boys.
Get us an apple.
No doubt it will be all of them tonight.
Except for Joe and Allen.
And your Jim Hawkins.
The boys need to take the ship now, John.
We're tired of the wait.
We still need to get eyes on that map.
Your boy ain't gonna get it us.
We need to raid that cabin ourselves and kill the boy with the others.
No, he's one of us.
That lad will be as good a buccaneer as the best of us.
If he doesn't get that map, we will wait until Trelawney organises his digging party, that's when he has to produce it and that's when we'll strike.
Not before.
Have I your word?
Do you think I've come this far not to kill them?
You think I want that captain or that Squire turning up and operating the rich man's law?
When I call it, I'm gonna kill that Bible-reading hypocrite with my own bare hands.
Will you help me, Jim?
Come and help me.
Land ahoy!
Off the starboard bow!
Anchor away!
Tomorrow morning, Squire Trelawney will be leading an expedition to the inland of the island to proceed with his business.
I thought, Captain Smollett, I might lead an exploratory party this afternoon.
No, my men won't be doing any work this afternoon.
They will rest, I think they need that.
Captain, may I remind you... You may not, or Mr Trelawney.
My orders are to rest the crew, is that understood?
To give these men extra rations of grog.
You're free to be masters of your own enjoyment, boys.
Those who wish to visit the island, Mr Merry, Mr Silver, would you organise boats and provisions.
Pleasure, sir.
Curfew is set for dusk.
May I pass on the boys' thanks for your excellent seamanship.
Delivering us safe and with God's grace to our port of call.
Three cheers for the Captain.
Hip-hip... Hooray!
Hip-hip... Hooray!
One for the grog.
Hip-hip... Much appreciated, sir.
Can't deal with much more of this patience lark, John.
Israel, you can and you will.
Are you coming, Alan?
Joe?
Come on, lads.
Is there room for me, Mr Silver?
Always room for you, Jim.
You're going, Jim?
Yes, will you come too, Doctor?
Please, will you come?
No, but I'll want a report on what it's like.
Flora and fauna.
Interesting to see for myself tomorrow.
He's in good company, Doctor.
Don't worry.
Good.
Told his mother I'd look out for him.
Starboard side!
Do you know what one of these is, Widow Hawkins?
Can you read?
No, Mr Redruth.
Widow Hawkins, this is a legal document.
Made between your late husband and my client Squire Trelawney.
Your husband borrowed money, did you know that?
No.
Is that his sign?
Yes.
It would only have been to cover the rent, ask for leeway.
Before the squire left four weeks ago, he instructed me to take possession of the inn as it went into arrears.
This is my home.
Not from tomorrow, Mrs Hawkins.
Joe, help me out with that.
Have you stolen from me?
No, sir.
Where is it?!
Trelawney.
Have you stolen from me?
Where's the map?
Have you stolen from me?!
Get Jim!
Get up the stairs, get above deck!
I've had my eye on you.
You're as smart as paint, remind me of Long John when I was young.
Fancy free.
Alan and I know there's talk of taking the ship, Mr Silver.
Well, that's why I want to talk to you, Joe.
Either you and Alan are gold dust.
But when the killing starts, there'll be no middle man.
Long John, I'm an honest man.
Appreciate that.
My daddy always told me to be honest, John.
My daddy said the same thing.
Maybe they knew each other.
So, Alan and I are going to step aside.
When it's time, we want no part of it, only job safe so we can catch on honest path home.
Please, sir.
Please!
No!
That was Alan.
Let me go!
What have you done to him?
Is this is starting?
Alan!
Jimmy.
Come here, Jimmy.
Help me up.
Good.
Wipe this.
Nice and clean.
You get used to violence, Jimmy.
You understand that without it, without carrying through on the threat of it... Clean both sides.
...other men will take what's yours.
That's the truth.
And they live the life that should be yours.
Couldn't get him with us, John.
It's a bonny job, Mr Hawkins.
So, Jim, what's it to be?
Where are you standing, boy?
Not yet.
Not yet!
The other deck, Mr Joyce.
Hold the stern, Trelawney!
Hold the stern!
Mr Gray!
Livesey!
I'm gonna kill you!
In here, Dr Livesey.
Quickly.
Hurry with the chest.
Cover the door!
Cover the door!
Get in the boat.
Everybody get in the boat, get in the bloody boat right now!
Jimmy, get in the boat!
What do we do?
Get in the Jolly Boat, try and make it to the island.
I'm not leaving without my map.
We can't hold the ship, sir.
Silver will come and help us from the beach.
Silver is the ringleader, Captain.
They're Flint's old crew.
All of them.
Squire, on the map, sir.
There was a stockade indicated.
Some kind of a stronghold on this side of the island.
Yes, that.
Left of the beach where Silver is.
Let's try it.
Quickly, quickly.
Hurry.
They're in the other jolly boat!
Use the cannon!
Shoot them out of the water!
Hurry!
Fire!
Get out of the boat, get out of the boat!
Head them off!
We just got in.
Now you're gonna get out.
Come on!
Jimmy?
Mr Trelawney, take the gun crew out.
Go again!
Load her up!
Jimmy!
Jimmy!
Come back, boy!
Jim!
John!
We need you!
Come on, John.
Jimmy!
They're heading for their fort.
Come on, we'll cut them off.
Gentlemen, pull it.
Get all the provisions!
Who's that?
Who's there?
I will not show one ounce of weakness to Mr Silver and his men.
We have ammunition for one fight.
You're posturing will get us killed.
The time has passed for patience.
Please, sir, please, don't.
Give me the map.
We haven't got it.
Then give me the boy.
"We are the same."
You wait for your husband, I for my son.
He's gonna hit us as soon as he can now he has no choice.
He's coming.
Sharpen your blades, lads.
It's time to play the reaper.
We're dropping like flies.
Flint is dead!
That's the Black Spot, Jimmy.
What are you doing?
There's no law here.
I won't join you, Silver.
We're not always the men we hoped we would be.
The ship, the bloody ship has disappeared!
You think you could cope with killing, Jim?
You're a thief and a murderer!
Put Mr Silver in irons.
I'll make a fine gentleman, Jim Hawkins.
Quickly, there it is.
They're gaining on us.
Hurry, they're gaining on us!
Hurry!
Mr Joyce.
Get over!
Reload!
Get back, boys!
They've got our range.
Mr Hunter, Mr Joyce, stay on the wall.
Shoot anything that moves.
What is that?
Colours.
Please, sir.
Please don't.
My name is Jim Hawkins.
Jim, what's Christian about you then?
What?
What's Christian about you?
My name is Jim, Jim Hawkins.
Like the hawk, Jim?
Like the hawk?
That's right.
You have a piece of heaven on you?
Piece of cheese is like a piece of heaven, I say that.
I ain't got no cheese.
No heaven then.
My godly duty is to kill all those with the devil in their eye.
There are those who come to us in devil form, stringy meat.
That old John Silver could cut into a stew, he could.
Not Ben Gunn, Ben Gunn just sizzles.
You know John Silver?
That's Silver on the beach, I saw.
Silver in the sea.
Yes.
Flint.
Not Flint.
Flint is dead.
You are the devils that have come to kill Ben Gunn?
No.
Steal his palace?!
I'm not one of Flint's crew.
Up there.
Get up!
Walk on, Jim.
Walk on.
Whoa, boys, what's the game here?
You see where they're hiding, John Silver.
One lucky shot and they're taken out.
You'll have the luck of the Devil to take all six of them, with double shot.
Especially knocking back the rum, boys.
Get out of the way, Silver.
Cook the food.
It's a double shot.
Load her up!
George, we've got no powder to waste, we've got that Squire and Captain where we want them.
Like rats in a trap.
Like rats in a trap.
Listen to Tom with that sudden burst of wisdom.
Don't go wasting your advantage trying to shoot birds in a nest from here.
Says who?
Cook the food, Barbecue.
Says your captain is what I am.
We all agreed your captain is gonna turn a blind eye to the mutiny you started before I gave the word.
Time has passed for patience.
Because you've got Flint's treasure map now.
Not yet.
The Squire ain't got it, has he?
Been taken from his cabin.
Tom, get the grill going on the deck.
Aye, John.
Everyone seems a little peckish.
Famished, John.
I could eat a horse.
We're fresh out of horses.
How about fish?
In God's name, please strike the colours, Captain Smollett.
No.
They're acting as a mark for our position, can you not see?
If I strike the colours, I strike my authority, Mr Trelawney.
I will not show one ounce of weakness to Silver and his men.
Your posturing will get us killed.
The more they shoot with their bellies full of rum, the more they will waste.
This is absurd.
Stay where you are.
Hunter, Joyce.
Sir.
Stay on duty, boys.
Matters are fine.
Now, question.
When you planned this expedition, did you prepare for a relief vessel to come searching as is practice should we not be back in Bristol by a certain date?
I did not, sir.
How long will our stores last, Captain?
Three days, Dr Livesey.
Three days.
And we have ammunition for one fight.
Short on melody, strong on purpose, don't you think?
What did you do that for?
I did that because buried on that island is our money.
Money we earned with Flint.
Through our honest murder and gift for thievery.
Now, you can jump around here like bloody monkeys in the trees or we can work out how to go over there and go and get it.
Quiet, boys.
There's a sober man talking.
We all know how trustworthy is a man that doesn't drink, don't we, boys?
Now, this afternoon, I'll get my council when those intellectuals among us were trying to shoot down a flagpole from over 1,000 yards.
What did that get us?
You say it, Long John.
Nothing.
Did it get us a map?
It did not.
Did it get the cannon over to that island where it could wreak some proper damage?
Well, what do we do next?
What we do is send a spy and watch their camp and find out where the boy is.
Who'll be our spy, John?
Can you swim, Tom?
Yeah...
So, Tom is our spy and the rest of you can act like a crew!
Respecting me again as captain.
So who is for me?
See your paws.
Bloody unanimous.
Move.
Stay.
Do you want to do it?
Forgive this devil for all he's done.
You see my rescue then?
You made this boat?
From the skin of these devils.
It's not Flint's Walrus, but I'll be back in the colonies one day.
Me and the rescue out on the sea.
Did you sail with Flint and Silver?
'First boy I was then.'
Like you, I was.
Walk.
Don't ask me no more now.
Where are you taking me?
Walk on.
Now!
Them colours, Christian Jim.
Captain Smollett.
That's where you'll go.
This stinking paradise ain't got no arms for you, boy.
Go, boy.
Go on.
Hey!
Who's that?
Don't shoot, Jim Hawkins.
I've brought food.
Who are you with, Jim?
No-one, Mr Hunter.
Get your hands in the air.
Who sent you?
No-one.
What do you want?
To speak with the Captain.
Did Silver send you?
No, he didn't.
This boy is a spy.
No.
I ran away from that murderer, I've been in the island.
We should hang him for the traitor that he is.
Bind him, Mr Joyce.
Sir.
Captain... Come on.
Doctor, you know me.
You knew my father.
Your father is a waster, Hawkins.
A debtor.
As untrustworthy as you are.
Now Silver is your father, you will answer for it before the law.
No.
Captain, I want to be with you now.
I've done nothing to endanger...
Hold your tongue, Hawkins!
Squire, he's just a boy.
Bind him to the post.
Sir.
Thank you.
Appreciate the help.
Appreciate your kindness, missus.
And when Squire Trelawney's men comes again, I will reason with him.
Ask him not to evict us.
Because, Mrs Silver, my son is on an expedition with the Squire himself at this very moment.
Which promises great reward for them all.
And with that reward, my son will be able to settle his father's debt.
Sure of it.
But I won't stay long, Mrs Hawkins.
I need to try Bristol again.
My husband's a seafaring man.
He's a good man.
I'll find a way of getting to him.
Then we are the same.
You wait for your husband, I for my son.
What do you think, Flint?
Flag of truce.
Flag of truce.
See it?
I'm waving it.
What do you want with your flag of truce, Silver?
Captain Silver, sir.
To come aboard and have a parley.
Make some terms.
Hunter, you cover the west wall, Gray take the north.
Dr Livesey, watch the scoundrel like a hawk.
I don't know a Captain Silver.
Well, since the original captain deserted his ship, come and put his pretty little rag somewhere new, those poor fatherless boys out there elected me in instead.
And reluctantly, I've stepped up to the responsibility.
I see you've caught one of our best.
Jim.
Arrest this man, Captain Smollett.
Keep your gun and your mouth quiet, Trelawney.
Is that clear?
Flag of truce.
Pipes of peace.
You want to parley proper?
I do want to parley proper.
I want to parley proper with the pipes of piece.
Which is quite difficult to say this early in the morning.
Now, you are outnumbered.
You ain't got the ship, there's no relief coming.
You don't need a spineless quack to tell you there's pestilence in this place.
So, we should take the map.
Hand it over and we won't kill you.
You know what I never understood about you buccaneering men?
It's not really about the money, is it?
You rob, you steal.
Get your hands on riches more than a decent man like me will ever see.
There is no contentment there, is there, Silver?
For many, that's true.
For many, it's a life.
And they die in the life.
But that's not me, Captain Smollett.
That's not Long John.
I'm gonna live out my days in fine clothes with my fine wife, riding in carriages.
Back in Bristol, I've got me a bank account.
You stay alive and you'll see that now.
Give me the map.
We haven't got it.
We know you have it.
Then give me the boy.
Show us this act of mercy and I'll return the mercy by letting you be.
Let the boy go.
No.
Let him choose.
Captain.
You keep to your word, Silver.
As a captain.
Aye-aye, Captain.
Come on, Jimmy.
Just keep walking.
Take it out your pockets and we're well away.
Pleasure settling with you, gentlemen.
You've got a new family now.
I'll look after you like you were my own son.
That I will, Jim.
Captain Smollett, I have the map, sir.
Give it to me!
I stole it for him, that's what he asked of me.
But I never gave it to him because I knew it to be wrong.
It's them that are the wrong'uns, you saw it with your own eyes.
Get out, Silver!
Come with me, Jimmy.
Where you belong.
The next time I see you, you'd better come bladed up.
I will, Smollett.
I will.
Those that die, they'll be the lucky ones!
You're a thief, boy!
You're a thief!
You're the thief!
You stole me the Doctor our share of the map!
And that was thievery!
You're the thief!
Squire!
Squire Trelawney.
Go on, you murdered the last man that hit you.
Gun down, sir.
I wanted to go with Silver and his men.
Cos I saw no other way to stay living because his stubbornness and his greed was leading us under the knives of the cut-throats.
That's enough.
Cos the way you treat Mr Arrow.
I saw little difference between their law and his.
I was scared for my life.
I was scared for my life to follow this man any more.
Did you get the map?
John!
Sorry, John.
He's gonna hit us as soon as he can now has no choice which is what we want.
I want us all on the perimeter.
When you spot them, I want you all in there.
That's you as well, Jim.
Sharpen your blades, lads.
It's time to play the reaper!
Your father was not untrustworthy, Trelawney was wrong to say that.
I should have said so myself at the time.
He was a good friend, and a good man to your mother.
You should be proud of him.
Silver's got his fighting face, he's coming.
Don't tell them of Benny Gunn, will you?
Don't tell that devil about.
He'll kill me as he'll kill you.
Why?
Betrayal.
Betrayal of his crew.
That's what I am.
And when he knows that, he'll send me down to the hot place, Jim.
Don't let him send me down to the devils.
All I want is a piece of heaven.
How did you betray him?
I struck a deal with another crew, I did.
I wanted the treasure for myself.
Brought them to the island and we looked all over for days.
But they got angered.
And tired of me.
Left me alone.
Then alone.
For my punishment.
How long?
I counted 1,000 days.
But I say a quick prayer when Sunday's due.
Most of that I spent looking for gold.
Come and help us fight.
No, you'll die before you beat that devil.
But if miracles happen, tell your captain to meet me on the high rock.
And not to bring colours.
But cheese.
Tell him to bring cheese.
I want it, Jimmy.
That's all Benny Gunn wants.
I want my heaven back.
All in.
Come on.
Dr Livesey take the door, fire through the porch.
Hunter, the north side.
Aye, Captain.
Gray and Trelawney, take the east.
That's where the big wave will come from.
They're all inside.
George, take half the men and go for the north.
Then sharp to the block house, Dick and I will cover.
The rest of you, go from the east, we'll pinch them in the middle.
On my first shot, lads.
Gentlemen.
Aim for the centre of the body.
Make it count.
You listen for my voice in the melee.
Don't shoot Smollett.
He's mine.
And Squire.
And don't shoot the boy.
He's mine.
Then there is no-one left for me to shoot at.
Think you can do a job for me there, Doctor?
Yes, yes.
My gun, my gun!
Get up!
Pistol, pistol!
Hawkins, hurry!
Go on, boys!
No mercy!
Surrender!
Please no!
Bring them out, lads!
Come on, let me get at them!
Take the door, man the door!
Hold it, hold it!
Put the weight on it!
Mr Gray!
Kill them!
Kill them all!
Hawkins.
Sit.
Are you hurt?
Come on, lads, let me see them!
Fire, fire it!
Got him, yes!
What... Get...
He's a bloody doctor!
Get away.
Go on!
Get away.
Out of here, get out of here!
Push them back.
George!
Help me get the Captain back inside.
Covering fire, Mr Gray.
Long John.
Come, let's go!
Watch your step, sir.
Sit you here, Captain.
How many did we get?
Six or seven made it out.
That's better odds.
Squire.
Please help me.
You lily-livered cowards.
Didn't see you fighting there, Silver.
I'm covering fire.
I've got one leg.
I'm suppose to hobble them to death?
We're so near the money, boys.
Get off the grog!
Now, you two go and get the deck cannon.
That will do it for us.
Go on.
Go on!
We'll set up camp here.
I'm hurt bad, John.
Let's look.
Tom.
Lad.
Will you read to me, sir?
Yes.
When you get home... you'll be home with us.
Tell my children their father loved them.
Say thank you to my wife.
"The lord is my shepherd."
Sir... "I shall not want."
I will tell them.
Will you see them right, sir?
"He maketh me to lie down in green pastures."
"He leadeth me beside the still waters."
"Ye though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death."
"I will fear no evil."
Rachel.
"My rod, my staff, my comfort."
My son is out in the world alongside Squire Trelawney raising all the money we need.
Make your sign here, Widow Hawkins.
But Mr Redruth, you don't listen.
My son is on a venture with Squire Trelawney.
Please don't do this.
And when he returns, sir he should have money enough to pay his father's debt.
I doubt the wages of the cabin boy will even dent the interest.
No, you don't understand.
My understanding, woman, is Squire Trelawney's orders were to take possession of this property while he was away.
On your way, girl, go on.
No.
Why are you burning?
What you can't carry from this place today will be sold or destroyed as is the law, woman.
They're my husband's clothes!
They're my son's!
Make your sign.
You headed for Bristol?
I was thinking that.
You know people there?
You have money?
Your son Jim is with this Trelawney?
Yes.
My John has a berth on that voyage.
Yes.
I saw your son in Bristol before they sailed, that's how I knew this was a place for me to come.
You saw Jim?
My John said he would look out for him.
He's a good man, my John.
I think he can have sympathy.
He showed sympathy when he found me.
Which was where?
Where will you go?
Where he paid for my company then took me out of that house.
I think there is a place we could stay.
At least for tonight.
Dig two separate holes for these boys, don't bundle them in with the other scum.
That's fine, sir.
You get a shovel, that's what we'll do.
The boy will do the shovelling, he's staying here.
You and Dr Livesey will go with me to get the treasure.
We'll get picked off one by one.
Don't question my authority.
We can't defend this place if we don't have any shot and I have the map which is the upper hand by any score.
And I will go hunting!
We won't follow you, sir.
He's right, Doctor.
We can't defend that place again.
Not even against seven.
Especially if he thinks they get that cannon off the ship.
There's a man who could help us.
His name's Ben Gunn.
He's no friend of Silver's and he knows the island.
We think he may know of somewhere more secure for us than here.
He could hide us out somewhere.
He's survived here for three years.
It's worth a try.
We can't stay here.
You know where to meet him?
He told Jim of a place and said he wants contact.
I'll find it, sir.
Take Trelawney with you.
No, no.
He's good with a sword.
Sir, the Squire still has thought for only one thing.
It's a fool who looks for treasure now.
I'll go alone.
Pistol for one shot.
Thank you.
Cheese like Jim said.
If he's trouble, don't think twice about binding him.
That's what I was thinking.
Jim, I owe you an apology.
No.
For so much.
The simple truth is, I think... we're not always the men we hoped we would be.
That's the truth.
Just don't lose the cheese.
Silver's made camp on the beach.
He's waiting for the cannon.
He's got men hoisting it off the ship now.
We're dead if he gets hold of that.
We can't stop them.
Not with the ship so near.
Glass, missus.
Thank you.
It's through this way.
Dr Livesey also leads the venture with Squire Trelawney.
He is a friend of my husband.
I know he wouldn't mind.
I've been asking all round for you.
You're one difficult bitch to find.
Trawled every tollgate, every turnpike out of Bristol till I got wind you walked this road.
I'm leaving a silence now in our talk because I'm angry Long John's money is not in your package.
You got it?
She knows nothing about it.
Who are you?
Who am I?
Black Dog.
I'm your nightmare, love.
Where's his money, girl?
Cos I'm...
I'm having it.
Leave here alone!
You've got what you came for, now leave.
Get out!
I am.
I'm going.
I'm going.
Get out!
Get out of here!
Who's that?
What?
Spooks in there, Silver.
I swear it.
Just sit up.
Should have never left port on a Friday, John.
It's the day they killed our Lord.
You listening to those Christian folk?
You'd be scared silly just waking up in the morning.
They're not getting that cannon off, are they?
They're hitting the bottle.
They'll be here by morning.
Ben Gunn?
Push, my love.
Push, push!
David.
Was it a boy?
Yes.
No-one could have saved us.
What's Christian about you then?
What?
What name you go by?
David.
David, David, David.
Are you the captain, Dave?
I have cheese for you.
Jim told me you liked cheese.
Should I leave it here?
There's cheese on there, then is it?
Yes.
I want to go home.
We all do, Ben.
But we're in serious trouble now.
Silver has the ship and the cannon and we need your help.
We need to move from the stockade.
If you can find us a place of safety on the island, we can get you home.
I have a palace, Captain Dave.
The palace I built.
Where is it?
Is it safe?
Cold, sweetheart?
It's warm in me.
Stay here.
This way.
I'm cheaper than a pint.
Hey, how much, girl?
I'm talking to you, girl.
Get away!
Jesus.
I can't do this.
Listen, I ain't going back to this life either.
But we need money and there are rooms.
Maybe jobs in the kitchen, you can do that.
Come.
Where's the...
The thing?
Johnny.
Johnny.
Where's the...
The thing?
God.
What?
The bloody thing has disappeared.
What thing?
The thing.
With the mast and the sails and the occasional flag.
The ship.
The ship, the bloody ship has disappeared.
Where is it?
Look, Long John.
This is Flint.
This is not Captain Flint's doing.
That was Flint in the Mist, Long John.
And it was him we saw last night.
And now he's made our ship vanish.
The ship is Israel Hand's.
Israel's only fit for gallery, George.
He can't sail.
Where is it then?
I don't know.
This place is cursed, Long John.
We're dropping like flies.
And if Flint knows we're gonna cheat him out of his treasure, he's gonna come to us in the night and stab us as we sleep.
What was that for?
Flint is dead!
His ghost isn't.
Flag of truce.
Where's our ship?
I don't know where the ship is.
Come on, George.
Flag of truce.
George Merry.
This is a flag of truce.
The law states there will be no killing now.
There's no law here.
Ain't you noticed?
George.
What I've got to say, I say to the captain.
Gentleman to gentlemen.
What I saw yesterday, Doctor, you're turning into a fighting man.
Isn't that how it went, George?
Will you come doctoring to my boys?
Fevered up and Tom Morgan needs better nursing than me.
I'll do that.
Let's parley.
Wake up, Mr Hands.
Coming up on deck?
You're gonna tell me how to beach this ship.
Where have you come from?
Ship's drifted round the other side of the island, we need to bring her in.
Can we do it?
I'll bet you.
Israel could do it.
Just somebody to sail.
So, come on.
You want to take the wheel, Jim?
So, you're for the seafaring life, are you?
Neither was I. I got pressed about your age.
Them Navy types, they're crooks.
You know it pays?
I heard that.
You did, did you?
You think you could cope with killing, Jim?
You've got to be man enough not to care after it's all done.
I could cope.
You've got to be strong.
In a religious way.
Or have not thought for God at all.
I could cope.
I reckon we'll be about an hour or so, Captain Jim.
Look lively there, lad.
Are we on course, boy?
Two points starboard.
Two points starboard it is.
Bring her in slowly.
I ain't got no control of that, lad.
This is good.
Bring her in straight.
We're doing it.
Don't struggle, boy.
Don't struggle.
Let it come.
There you go.
Here's your test, boy.
Got your powder wet, did you?
You're gonna die now, boy.
You're gonna go up to your own place up there just like that man in the Bible.
I'm gonna kill you, boy!
Please.
Come here!
I'm gonna cut you.
Dr Livesey?
Captain Smollett?
James Hawkins.
Boy as smart as paint.
We're not having it.
We're gonna slit his throat.
Don't you poke up with the orders.
You left us with nothing!
We ain't got not shoot.
You tell him, George.
Got you the only fresh water on the island.
We came here for money that was owed.
And your captaincy ain't got us a single coin.
The boy is currency.
Why can't you see that?
The boy is awake.
Jim.
Where's the Captain?
Where's the Doctor, have you killed them?
What if we have?
We haven't.
Seen as the ship's gone, that doctor traded half our stores for this stream.
Now they've gone where they've gone.
But their parting words were that they were sick of you, Jim.
Sick of you and your turncoat wanderings.
So, now it seems you're back in my camp.
Or none at all.
I won't join you, Silver.
Not now, nor any day, never.
Slit him.
No.
I am your captain and I am sick of this killing.
You're still clinging to captaincy, John.
I'm calling a crew's conference.
Outside, boys.
Don't go out there, Tom.
Tom!
I've lost them, Jim.
Since the ship's gone, there has been a swell of anarchy.
And your half a blank away from death, boy.
I ain't afraid to die now, John.
Well, bully for you.
But you die here and that mother of yours is all alone in the world.
Are you thinking of that?
Jimmy, we've got to help each other a bit.
You and me is all we got now.
George Merry's gonna come for me.
It's in the air.
But I've got insurance.
In my pocket.
If you've got an ace in your collar, now's the time to reveal it, boy.
Cos God help me, I don't want to see you die.
God bless me for that.
Give me something so I can help you.
I have the ship.
It's beached up in the north.
It's safe.
The ship?
Hands and Anderson are dead.
I done some of that killing myself.
Well, we won't mention you killed their mates.
But the ship is good.
Good insurance.
Come outside, John Silver.
And bring the boy.
I said you was smart.
Step up then.
What you got?
It's the Black Spot, Jimmy.
We took a vote.
It's on account of your bungling, Silver.
And your best friend, patience.
It says "deposed" on the back.
We listened to you.
Now we've got no treasure, no map.
And we got no boys.
Cos you let them ride to the guns.
You were never man enough to be our captain, John.
So is it not man enough to say me and the boy have got the ship safe?
Where?
The boy knows.
And he ain't told me.
For payment he'll lead us there.
And that's the way it's going to stay.
You're lying.
Is it not man enough to say when that fierce doctor came and negotiated this morning, I got, through a captain's guile, possession of Flint's map?
The doctor gave you the map?
Prove it.
Don't touch.
That's it.
That's Flint's hand.
George, that's Flint's hand.
Why did you keep this from us?
What was the point without a ship?
But now I can surprise my loyal boys and say, "Let's go and make ourselves rich!"
Let's go now.
Shall we just throw this away, lads?
Yeah.
Tom?
Tom.
Get up, lad.
Got to think about what this treasure is gonna bring us.
Fine wines.
John, please.
Tell me more, John.
Turkish delight.
Houses as big as fields.
Carriages.
For you and all your ladies, Tom.
It's... all white in here.
John.
John.
Tom.
It says a pointer.
It'll be up, John.
Up.
What did you see?
John.
What is it?
Recognise that cap, boys?
That's Allardyce.
That's our captain's pointer.
What was that?
How far is it, Silver?
It's definitely Flint, that is.
It's alright.
What's that you say?
It's Captain Flint.
Is that you, Captain?
That's not Flint's voice.
What was it then?
That's his song.
I know that voice, that's a Yankee voice.
That's Ben Gunn.
Ben Gunn, that you out there?
That's Ben Gunn.
How can you be scared about him?
He was a runt when he sailed with us and he's a runt now.
I know your Yankee voice, Ben Gunn!
Right, and the Devil... Did you kill him?
Didn't I?
I did, yes.
Only 100 yards now, lads.
Then 12 paces from the tree.
Come on, let's go there.
Alright, hold on for your captain.
There's the tree.
That tree, that tree!
Wait.
Wait for your captain.
No.
This ain't good, Jim.
Stand by for trouble, boy.
Stay close to your John.
Two Guineas.
Two Guineas.
You're the man for bargaining, aren't you?
With your captain's guile.
This cripple has led us to nothing, boys!
Is two Guineas what a life's worth?!
Stand behind me, Jim.
Keep your guns on him, boys.
I'm gonna hang this mongrel from a tree.
Are you safe, Jim?
Yes, sir.
I see you've been excavating before us, Dr Livesey.
Not me.
He took two and a half years to find this spot.
Looked all over the island.
Young Mr Gunn.
Should I kill the devil, Captain Dave?
Kill all devils with the slit in their eye.
No, Ben, don't.
Don't.
Can someone tell me where my treasure is?
Captain Dave's treasure, it is.
Maybe Jim's.
Maybe his there who's name I forgot.
Don't know what he's called.
Bargained away the treasure for a cake of cheese and Trelawney's Bible, didn't you?
It's like a slice of heaven, Mr Silver.
It's everything you want.
Is it now?
This is my palace, Mr Jim.
Captain Smollett.
I'm safe, Jim.
Good to see you, young man.
What's he doing here?
Between him and Jim, the others are dead.
Me and Jim, sir.
I looked out for him, I did.
You're a mutineer, Silver.
Are you doing the adding up, Squire Trelawney?
A little bit of book work.
You're a mutineer.
And you'll be hanged as one when we get home.
I think the lad would talk of a different John Silver.
One who was forced to mutineer the crew he tried to control.
I've seen what kind of a man you are, Silver.
Silver came between me and a knifing, Captain.
He risked his neck on my behalf.
I hope everyone's listening to this honest young man.
Get that man in irons, Livesey.
No, let's try and have some better thoughts.
Words that befit gentleman.
Now, you did a deal with the professor of divinity over there.
Something about cheese and a Bible.
So he could do a deal with me.
They'll be no deal with you.
I'm the only one left alive who owns this gold, who earned this gold.
And ownership is nine-tenths of the law.
Possession is nine-tenths of the law.
That's a different law, not one I like.
I don't care what you like!
I don't care about the law!
You're a thief and a murderer!
You've brought peril and destruction to this whole enterprise!
All this.
This mirror here.
These sacks.
This chest, these coins.
They're now legally mine and in my possession.
My ownership because I have taken them through my venture and risk.
Trelawney.
The risk you took was with other men's lives.
I was talking of a risk financial.
Which does not exist separate to men's lives.
However you tried to insulate the thought that it might.
This is contraband, sir.
Stained thick with blood.
When we get back to England, if we manage to get off this island, it will be handed over as such.
Aye-aye.
I have the ship, sir.
Beached up on the north coast.
There is another way to end this.
Which is perhaps more palatable to the futures of all present.
Which is we share a little of what's won amongst all us loyal survivors.
And we share it, each according to his station.
And being the captain, sir... You being the captain...
Put Mr Silver in irons, Dr. Livesey.
He will be tried for mutiny.
In Bristol.
Sir.
Captain?
Been watching you, John.
Watching this last dance all the way.
I know that.
And I'll be the last thing you see when you do your little jig at execution dock.
I was loyal to you.
Loyalty.
Loyalty, John.
It's what you can hold in your hand.
Ben?
I've been thinking, Christian Jim.
Thinking of my home and what's there for me.
This is my home.
You're coming with us, Ben.
Now that the treasure has gone, no Devils will come and hurt me.
Take my heaven.
That's what Ben Gunn thinks, that's what he'll do.
What are you doing?
Protecting you.
From a world out there.
You'll do alright in the world.
No.
I've seen them.
Blistered and starved in the bolts of their gold.
There's no heaven out there.
This the right way, Hawkins?
Keep going, sir.
Bit more.
Get the nets as ballast to the quarterdeck, Jim.
We're gonna need much weight on the stern to help lift it off.
Dr Livesey, Mr Gray.
Sir.
Ditch that cannon from the bow.
The tide will do the rest.
'15 men on the dead man's chest.'
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum.
Let's go now.
What are you doing?
Stop that!
Stop that, what are you doing?!
Any more of that and I'll snap your neck.
It's all going.
Smollett, stop him!
Let him do it.
No!
It's two more bags to go, Jim.
Secure Mr Silver below deck, Mr Gray.
Aye, sir.
Let's get to Jamaica, we'll crew up and go home.
What is it?
There's word on the docks the Hispaniola has been seen flying her colours off Boscastle.
Jim's coming home.
This is wonderful, Jim.
Suitable feast for our last night.
On arrival in Bristol, I'll need the assistance of sergeant in arms.
I'll need to take Silver into custody.
Are you still planning on speaking up for him, Jim?
I am, sir.
I will too.
He chose to stand between Jim and death on two occasions.
You won't save him, Jim.
He's one of Flint's men.
He'll drop for that alone.
Do those potatoes like I told you?
I did.
Plenty of butter.
That's the thing.
Pad yourselves up for the chilly winters.
It's fit enough for the captain's table, this.
I've made a sea cook out of you.
When do we dock?
Tomorrow morning.
Something you can do for me.
The woman you met down the Spyglass.
My wife.
I don't want her coming to the trial and seeing me played out.
Will you see to that?
And give her this.
Take a bit for your mum.
But my girl gets the lion's share.
I'm a bloody thief, Jim.
They gave me a load of treasure and told me to drag it through the jungle.
Me and the parrot were thinking, we don't want a lad with prospects getting tainted by speaking up for one of Flint's crew.
So you don't do it.
Alright?
I don't want it.
You'll make a fine gentleman, Jim Hawkins.
Look at this mashed potato, mashed up to high heaven.
Fine enough to grace any captain's table.
You can go now.
Food for a couple of days.
A pistol and powder.
Jim.
You're a prince among thieves.
You taken your share?
You're about a mile and a half off the north Devon coast.
Jimmy, if you want help or advice...
I won't be coming to you.
Yeah, that's probably best.
But if you ever want a venture, want to feel that spirit inside, come looking for Long John.
He'll be waiting.
I will.
And keep Flint for me.
For safe keeping.
I'll come for him one day.
Remember, Jim.
Any fast living, come looking.
I'll be there, I will.
A gentleman.
As a fine gentleman, you are going to make.
Happy birthday, Mrs. Hawkins.
Yes, Mrs. Hawkins.
Younger every year.
None of your frippery, John Harrow.
But music and friends do make you feel... Where's Jim?
He's in the kitchen, I think.
Just put a head on that one, John.
It's going to thunder and lightning.
Then you best go lock yourself up in a closet.
You made that cake?
No, I didn't.
And I'll thank you not to say I did.
Jim Hawkins made a cake!
Jim Hawkins made a cake!
No, I didn't.
Only girls make cakes.
My mother made this cake herself.
Surely she had to have a cake for her birthday.
Jim Hawkins dropped a cake!
Jim Hawkins dropped a cake!
Jim Hawkins dropped a cake!
Stop following me around.
Upon my soul!
Why, Jim, you didn't go and bake a...?
Here's the cake you made, Mother.
I trust it's good.
It's the best cake ever.
I raise a mug to Jim Hawkins, proprietor of the Admiral Benbow.
Jim.
Speech!
Come on, get up.
Speech, speech.
Well, I don't know what to say, but ever since Father died... ...and with Mother having to do the work, I'm truly glad each time she gets older.
I mean, then I get older too.
And soon I'll be able to do all the work and won't have to make speeches.
Here she comes.
Everybody to the taproom.
We'll cut the cake in there.
Everybody take a seat.
Oh, Jim, there go the shutters.
Go up and close them, will you?
At your service, ma'am.
Now what?
I'm scared.
Aren't you scared?
No, I'm not.
It's girls that make me nervous.
Why don't you go downstairs, where there's more room to be scared in.
I want a bunk with a sea view.
This way, sir.
Have you seen this man around here before?
He looks like a seafaring man.
He certainly doesn't belong to these parts.
Hey!
I want a noggin of rum.
Yes, sir.
Mind, you clod.
Have an eye to that chest.
Here.
Now, you never made this voyage, you understand?
You never seen me and you don't know nothing.
Get out.
What are you looking for?
Strangers, sonny, strangers.
I don't like strangers coming aboard me suddenly.
Makes my spine jump like a porpoise, it does.
What might your name be?
Jim Hawkins.
Now, look here, Jim, you and me's going to be mates.
You'll get a silver four-penny bit every month... ...if you watches out for strangers and comes and lets the old captain know... ...when they tops the horizon.
Well, what manner of strangers?
Seafaring men.
Well, all seafaring men?
No, no, no, son.
There's a special cut of the jib to these seafaring men.
But most especially, I want you to keep your eye open... ...for a seafaring man with one leg.
A seafaring man with one leg?
Aye.
Upon my word, sir, what shall I tell them?
What do they want?
Never you mind what they want.
You go on down below and get me a noggin of rum.
A double noggin, Jim, because I'm becalmed.
Becalmed on a sea of troubles, and I've got to fill my sails again.
Yes, sir.
Who is he, Jim?
What did he say?
I don't know.
Something about seafaring men with no ears and no legs and no... Hey, drop anchor, matey.
We'll fill the cask where you lie.
Rum for all hands, say I.
Here's a new port all full of pretty wenches... ...and strong young buckoes.
Clear the decks for pleasant action.
Fill a pretty belly with grog and that's what makes the world... ...spin on its poles, say I.
Hey, belay there.
The rum.
I'm not much on strong liquor, sir.
Besides, we have to go now.
It's getting... "Go," say ye?
You'll stay.
You'll all stay.
Sit yourselves down on your binnacles.
Jim, matey, the rum.
I ain't like all seafaring men.
Genteel, I am, and a dove at heart, mates.
Why, I know some seafaring men, them as boarded a Spanish brig... ...all loaded down with Castilian dons and their beauteous ladies.
And what did they do?
Genteel like me, ye thinks?
No.
They slices them dons like bread loaves... ...and feeds them to the sharks.
And what did they do to the beauteous ladies?
Why, after courting their favor, as it were... ...saving your presence, matey... ...they slits the veins of their pearly white arms... ...and uses their blue blood to warm their rum.
And then what did they do, matey?
Bless my soul, sir, what else was left?
There was the song, Jim.
Singing by all hands.
Now, come on.
We'll all tip the stave.
Come on!
Come on, sing!
Bottle of rum, you old hag!
Bottle of rum!
"Bottle of rum!"
We'll tip it again now.
Come on!
Dr. Livesey.
Mrs. Hawkins.
It was Mother's birthday.
We were just having a little entertainment, doctor.
Well, my compliments, Mrs. Hawkins.
A little brandy, Jim.
My pleasure, sir.
Come on, mates.
Now we'll tip it again.
Thought sure we were in for a storm, but... Hey!
Silence there between decks.
You addressing me, sir?
Is it blowing a gale of wind you can't hear me?
What did I say?
I have only this to say: I don't know you.
But by your look, if you continue drinking rum... ...the world will soon be rid of a very dirty scoundrel.
I'll split you double, you...
If you do not lower that cutlass...
...I promise on my honor that you shall hang at the next assizes.
And furthermore, sir...
...I'm not only a doctor, I'm magistrate here.
And if I catch another breath of complaint against you... ...if only for a piece of incivility like this, I'll have you routed out of here.
Let that suffice?
I ask your patience, sir.
Just a squall from a poor old sailor man... ...who took too much rum over his bowsprit.
I ask your pardon.
It was a nice party.
Don't worry, Mrs. Hawkins.
Don't worry.
Goodbye.
Thank you.
Praise be, Jim, the man was only full of talk.
But bless my soul, sir.
He certainly can sing.
Well, sonny.
Come here.
Come here, sonny.
A little closer.
Here.
Now, is this here table for my mate Bill?
I don't know your mate Bill.
But don't Bill live here?
No.
Nobody but the captain.
Oh, captain, it is?
Truly, sir.
I can...
Here comes my old mate Bill now.
Bless his heart, to be sure.
Jim, lad!
The rum.
I'm becalmed again.
Come, Bill.
You know me.
You know an old shipmate, surely.
Black Dog.
Black Dog as ever was.
Come for to see his old shipmate Billy.
Well, speak up.
The porter, sonny.
Porter.
Well?
Now, Bill, I've been after you, now.
No, by the powers, and there's an end to it!
If it comes to swinging, swing one, swing all.
I'll part your dirty wig!
Out, you blubberous barnacle.
Next time I'll sever your gullet.
Humor him, Jim.
I'll be back.
Where you going?
To Mr. Doolittle's.
I'll get him to ride to Livesey's... ...so he and his constables can come and get that man out of here at once.
Rum, Jim.
Rum.
Are you hurt?
I gotta get away from here, Jim.
I gotta slip my hawsers.
Captain, you've been drinking too much.
Remember, the doctor said... Doctors is all swabs.
I've lived on rum, I tell you.
It's been meat and drink to me, man and wife.
And I needs rum now, Jim.
Mother locked up all the rum.
She said...
I've got to have it, Jim.
I gotta have it.
Look.
See how me fingers fidget?
I can't stop it, Jim.
I gotta have a drain of rum.
If I don't, I'll have the horrors.
And then I'll see Flint there behind you in the corner, just as plain as print.
Well, is Flint the one-legged man?
No, no, but he'll be there too.
Both of them will be there if you don't get me the rum.
Oh, go on, quick.
Before they come in and slips me the black spot.
Well, what's the black spot?
It's a summons, Jim.
A summons.
Do they wanna kill you?
No, no, it's my sea chest they're after.
What's in the sea chest?
Pieces of eight.
Pearls as big as ostrich eggs.
All the gold your heart can desire.
And just for a little noggin of rum, Jim.
Would a half a noggin do?
That's my matey.
There we go, lad.
Wait here.
I'll see.
Will any kind friend inform a poor blind man... ...who has lost the precious sight of his eyes in the gracious defense... ...of his native country, England, and God bless King George... ...where in whatever part of this country he may now be.
You are at the Admiral Benbow, Black Hill Cove, sir.
I hear a voice.
A young voice.
Will ye not take my hand, me kind young friend, and lead me in?
Certainly, sir.
I...
I... Now, boy, take me to the captain.
Well, no, sir.
Upon my word, I dare not.
Take me in straight or I'll break your arm.
Oh, it isn't for yourself, I mean.
He has his cutlass.
Another gentleman... Come, now, march.
Yes, sir.
Hi, Bill.
Your old friend Pew.
Now, sit where you are, Bill.
Gentlemanly-like.
I can't see, but I can hear even a finger stirring.
Business is business.
Now, right up to him.
Aye, Bill.
Now, boy, take his hand and bring it close to mine.
There.
That's done.
That's done.
We'll do him yet!
Not a doubloon.
I fought and bled for it.
It's mine.
Every farthing of it.
Mine!
I'm swing on Execution Dock... Jim, what's happened?
Why, he's dead.
"You have till 10 tonight."
Black spot.
And they'll be back again too.
Who will be?
The men that wanted to kill the captain.
They wanna own the treasure in his chest upstairs.
Let's get out of here.
No.
The captain owes us money.
We'll go get what he owes us.
They can't take that.
Jim, I'm so frightened.
I'll see no harm comes to you, Mother.
I'm not afraid.
We shouldn't, Jim, they'll... Come on, Mother.
He says there's gold and silver and pearls as big as ostrich eggs.
We'll show them we're honest.
We'll take what is our due and not a farthing over.
Why, there's nothing there at all.
There's some coins, though.
Open the door!
There's something.
I'll take what I have.
Up.
Down with it!
In!
In!
In!
Bill's dead.
Well, search him... ...some of you brass-brained lubbers.
Get the chest!
Aye, aye, sir.
Jim, I'm going to faint.
No, Mother.
Here.
Down with the door!
They've been here before.
Someone's turned out the chest alow and aloft.
Is it there?
There's some money.
Not money, you squid.
Flint's fist.
Flint's fist!
You below!
Is it down there?
It's that whining little sneaking brat.
I should have torn his arm off.
I should have put his eyes out!
Scatter and find him!
We'll have to budge, mates.
What?
Give him the whip.
Wait.
Johnny.
Black Dog.
Wallace.
You wouldn't leave old Pew, would you, mates?
After them, boys.
Scour the thickets.
Jim!
Jim!
Mrs. Hawkins!
Here we are, Dr. Livesey.
Here we are.
Oh, dearie me, dearie me.
Who were they?
They wanted to kill the captain.
But he dropped dead... ...just like you said he would.
Well, what did they say?
Well, they wanted something up in his chest upstairs.
Flint's fist or something, I don't know.
This is all I took.
Do you suppose that could be anything?
Flint's fist?
Well, there's only one Flint.
I know that.
Why, it's only a map.
What are those funny red crosses there?
"Bulk of treasure."
Bless my... Quickly.
Into the coach, both of you.
Vance, back here at once.
Well, where are we going, doctor?
To Squire Trelawney's.
Jim, my boy, you may have stumbled... ...on the secret of the century.
It's it.
It's it, I tell you.
Squire Trelawney, are you sure?
Sure?
The actual chart of Flint's treasure.
The very island it's buried on.
Latitude.
Longitude.
Jim, now, look here.
The very blockhouse and stockade... ...where the infamous pirate held off attack.
Squire, you get so confoundedly overheated.
What do you propose to do?
Why, bless me for a fat mole, we'll... We'll dig it up.
Won't we, Jim?
Won't we, young Hawkins?
I have my own shovel, sir.
Shovel?
Shovel?
You'll have more than that.
You'll be the richest lad in England.
In the whole world.
But, squire, a moment, now.
We'll need a ship.
We'll need a crew.
Tomorrow I leave for Bristol.
In two weeks from today, I'll have the finest ship... ...and the choicest crew in England.
Those cutthroats who attacked tonight have shown us that they'll stop at nothing.
Others too, perhaps.
We must proceed with absolute secrecy.
Exactly, sir.
Exactly.
Sphinxes, all.
Do you hear that, Jim?
Sphinxes.
Sphinxes, all.
There's just one man I'm afraid of.
And who's that, sir?
Who's that?
Name the dog.
You, sir.
For you cannot hold your tongue.
I?
I?
Why, doctor, blast me, I... Livesey, you're always in the right of it.
I'll be as silent as a grave.
Tallyho, Jim.
How are you, my boy?
It was a wondrous ride, sir.
Where's our ship?
We all ready to sail?
Not for several days.
Dr. Livesey won't be here till Saturday.
Hunter.
Where's our ship, sir?
Ship?
Ship?
There she lies.
The good ship 'Hispaniola'.
And a tighter craft never sailed the seven seas.
Bless my soul, sir.
All right, now, give them another broadside.
All together.
One, two, th... Well, sonny, was you aiming to blow the other leg off?
I don't think it's loaded.
Well, you ought to be certain.
You be the captain of that ship, now, be'n't you?
Well, I... Come on, Jim, I'll show you to your... Oh, he wanted to know if I was captain.
My captain is on his way from Dover.
Is there anything I can do?
No, thank ye, sir.
Just an old sailor hobbled down... ...to get a smell of the salt air and cast these eyes on a trim craft... ...the likes of which you sure have got here.
Yes, I think I have a good eye for a ship.
Do you mind if I just come aboard, please?
Just for a spell.
Yes, you're... You're welcome, my man.
Of course.
Squire, sir.
This way.
Squire.
This way, my friend.
Any assistance?
Well, well... Silver's the name.
Long John Silver, they calls me.
At your service, sir.
Mr. Silver, sir.
Trelawney's my name.
Squire Trelawney.
And this is our cabin boy, Jim.
Jim Hawkins.
Aye, matey.
Smart as paint, I'll warrant, huh?
Smart enough to see you've only one leg.
Jim, boy.
Yes, sir.
You're pretty smart, Jim.
So was that French gunner who touched off the ball... ...that blew that old leg of mine overboard.
You served in the navy, my man?
Aye, aye, sir.
Under Admiral Hawke, off Biscay.
Under the immortal Hawke?
Aye, aye, sir.
Are there many one-legged seafaring men?
Why, the country's full of them, matey.
Just like storks on a roof.
Truly, Mr. Silver, I'm sorry for my bluntness.
Here, matey, you try this out.
Of course, you realize we can only sign on able-bodied men.
Oh, bless me, sir.
I didn't think when I came hobbling down here... ...that you'd have any use for this timber leg and me.
Oh, no, no.
Now, you don't happen to have... ...a cook onboard, do you?
Cook?
Why, no, not yet.
Well, squire, I own a little sailor's tavern up here, and I can make salt pork... ...taste just like roast pheasant.
Why, damn me, Silver, if you want the berth, you're hereby made ship's cook.
Silver, this port is full of the most unreliable men.
Of the dozen or so that I signed on, eight have never come back.
Disappeared entirely.
Oh, no.
Now, ain't that a shame.
I wonder what could have happened to them.
Shiftless idiots.
How many men might you be needing, squire?
I should like a round score of stout fellows, in case of savages or buccaneers.
Oh, now, you be scared of pirates, huh?
Well, Silver, one never knows.
Not presuming, sir, but I know every able-bodied seafaring man... ...in the town of Bristol.
What say you that I fetch a flock of them right down here to you?
Fetch them down.
Fetch them down, Silver.
Why, strike me pink.
We may get Smollett's entire crew for him... ...and be able to sail sooner, eh, Jim?
Aye.
Aye, aye, sir.
With your eye for seamen, sir...
Here, matey.
There you are.
Oh, sir, mayn't I go with Mr. Silver?
Well, Jim... Oh, no.
No, no, no.
There's a lot to be done.
But, sir, I want to go.
Please.
Oh, now, take the boy along, Silver.
Take him along.
Show him the port, the ships.
Start his education for him.
All right.
Come on, matey.
Come on.
That's the way it be, matey.
That's the way it be.
Then you surely would have been a captain if you hadn't lost your leg.
Come on, lads, come on.
Overboard with ye.
Oh, yes, I'd be captain.
I'd be captain, matey.
Here.
Help yourself to a boatswain's pipe.
There you are.
Here.
Thank you.
Let me show you how to blow it.
Oh, thank you, Mr. Silver.
Now you blow it.
This is my little inn, Jim, as I keep for sailors as ain't appreciated.
Mateys, this is Jim Hawkins, ship's boy off the 'Hispaniola'.
Hi there.
Aye, lad.
You might be glad to know that I've been made ship's cook.
Just friends, Jim.
All happy to know that old John's gonna get his health back.
They wouldn't be needing any other hands, would they, John?
Them as is worthy, George.
I've just been yarning with the ship's owner.
Maybe I can convince him of your high qualities, them as has them.
Oh, John.
That's the kind of joke, Long John.
Now, this here is Dandy Dawson.
A gentleman, is Dandy.
Took to the sea for the love of it, he says.
Wouldn't harm a cockroach.
Your servant, sonny.
My pleasure, Mr. Dawson.
And this is William O'Brien.
Now, William is a lay reader in the church, is William.
Lost his ear defending a woman.
A maid in Santiago that he had taken unto his heart, as it were.
As it were, sonny.
Bless my soul.
And, matey, this is Israel Hands.
Ugly Israel, we calls him, but as honest a man as you'll find in the room, Jim.
My pleasure, Mr.
Hands.
You come on a fair breeze, Master Hawkins.
Where's John?
Stop him!
Stop him!
Here, here.
Jim, Jim, Jim.
Here, here.
Who is he?
It's Black Dog.
Who?
Black Dog?
Who?
What's he done?
He was one of the buccaneers... A buccaneer?
Not one of the pirates that Squire Trelawney was telling us about?
Yes.
He ought to be caught.
Now, have any of you ever seen the likes of him before?
No, John.
He ain't a friend of anybody in here, be he?
No.
No, John.
That's good.
That's good for all of you.
If I ever catch any of you running alongside the likes of that, why, I'll... A scurvy pirate in my inn.
You wait here, matey.
I'll run and get me sea bag and me bird.
And we'll go right up and tell the squire about this.
Blimey.
Pirates.
Those are pretty boots, Master Hawkins.
Yes.
My mother gave them to me before I left.
And the same size our foot is.
Alike as two sister craft.
Yes.
I'm fond of pretty things, I am.
Yes.
Oh, a parrot.
Yes, matey.
If any of you wants a voyage, you go right down to the 'Hispaniola'.
She's lying in Wolf's Wharf.
Is it a boy or a girl parrot?
No, Jim, a girl, and usually a well-mannered little wench, too, says I.
Pieces of eight, pieces of eight, pieces of eight, pieces of eight.
Upon my word, she's a good talker.
Well, I wouldn't say "good," Jim, but powerful.
What's her name?
Captain Flint, I calls her.
Here, matey.
You take her for a spell.
She likes you, Jim.
But does she bite?
No, no.
Nary a nibble.
I thought most parrots liked to bite.
Not this one.
She's a lovebird, matey.
You know, I've been thinking about the squire, matey.
Yes, Mr. Silver.
You just call me Long John.
Yes, Long John.
You know, I don't think... ...that we ought to tell him about that Black Dog, now, do you?
Well, why not?
Well, the squire is very excitable.
He's got a lot on his mind, now, ain't he?
Well, yes.
Well, now, we didn't catch Black Dog, and there's nothing can be done... ...about it, is there?
Well, I know, but... Well, now, there's Admiral Hawke.
I remember in a battle off of Lisbon... ...why, a young lieutenant tells him something without using his judgment... ...and do you know what happened?
Why, that admiral fell in a fit... ...and pink foam oozed out of his ears for 42 days.
Out of his...?
All that time?
Yes, sirree.
Just like two spigots... ...out of a barrel of ale.
So just for the peace of the mind of the squire, why, we won't tell him, huh?
I believe you're right, Long John.
Matey, you're just smart as paint.
Why, you and me's gonna get along just fine in my galley.
She did bite me.
Now, ain't that too bad.
Well, matey, I guess she ain't used to you.
She's a little bit jealous, yeah.
I guess you don't want to leave old Long John alone, do you?
You... Just a little kiss, matey.
Yes.
You clam brain.
Is a crew always happy like that when they leave a port?
A good crew, Jim.
You know, if this voyage were a rainbow... ...and there was a pot of gold at the other end... ...they couldn't be any happier.
I'm glad you like Dr. Livesey.
Now, he's a pretty smart man, Jim.
He's not a sailor, of course.
But he can cut you open and sew you up again.
Well, that sewing up must be pretty difficult.
So is the cutting-up part.
Yeah, well, experience, Jim.
I couldn't do it.
Oh, no.
Neither could I. I'd swoon like a lady of quality, I would.
I guess I'm kind of sensitive-like.
To the squire, with my compliments, Jim.
Mulled wine, sir, with Long John's compliments.
And Silver forgets nothing.
Along with me, he's going to be certain... ...that this is a voyage that we shall all remember.
Long John's a wonderful man, sir.
Livesey, I give you...
Yes, yes, yes, yes?
Captain Smollett.
All well, I trust.
Everything shipshape and seaworthy?
I may as well speak plain, gentlemen, at the risk of offense.
I don't like this voyage.
That's short and sweet.
Pray explain yourself, sir.
I was signed on under sealed orders... ...to sail this ship wherever you'd bid me.
But I've arrived at the conclusion that every hand before the mast... ...knows more about the voyage than I do.
I don't call that fair.
Do you?
Certainly not.
What do the men know?
That we're going after treasure.
Oh, mind you, I've heard it whispered on all sides.
So has my officer, Mr. Arrow.
Livesey, I never uttered a word.
It must have been either you or the boy here.
Oh, upon my word, sir, I never...
So treasure it is, I see.
You mean you don't trust the crew?
Oh, some of them may be honest.
British naval heroes, all of them.
Yes, when there's treasure in the hole, there's fire in the forecastle.
So I'm taking certain precautions before we sail.
And by your leave, I'd ask you gentlemen to help me.
Lay forward on the quarterdeck.
Two inches off those points, boatswain.
Aye, aye, captain.
Captain, sir, what are we to make of this?
Why, me and Dick and Allan...
I never had me knife broke afore, captain.
It's a habit of mine on long voyages.
Sometimes hands get restless.
Captain's right, Jim.
Honest hands never object to having their knives tipped.
Boatswain, take the larboard watch.
Have the powder moved out of this forehold back under the aft cabin.
Aye.
Larboard watch.
Spring the hatch to the forehold.
Captain, that means that I'll have to move all my provision.
I stored them aft especially so the vegetables wouldn't get mildewed.
My orders, man.
You get to your galley.
The hands will want their dinner.
Aye, aye, captain.
Well, why do you men stand here?
Do as you're told.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Well?
No sign of arms, sir.
You gentlemen are determined to make this cruise?
Like iron, sir.
Weigh anchor, Mr. Arrow.
Aye, aye, sir.
Now, here, matey.
What's to do?
The captain ordered us to move our bunks aft.
With the gentlemen, huh?
That's fine, Jim.
Oh, but I'd rather be forward with you.
Well, how's this: Supposing I ask the captain to change bunks with me.
That is, after we settles down to sail.
Here, you, ship's boy.
Get along with that.
I'll have no favorites aboard my ship.
If there's one honest man aboard, it's Captain Smollett.
Honest, if you will, but an intolerable humbug.
I consider his conduct unmanly, unsailorly and downright un-English.
Bless my soul.
Why does the captain have to bellow at me?
Captain's ways, Jim.
Captain's ways.
Now, I wonder what could have thrown the captain into such a sudden squall, matey.
Oh, well, he wanted to...
I don't know.
I wish you were the captain of this ship, Long John.
I'll wager you could handle this boat better than he could.
No, matey, the captain's a man of wisdom.
A lot of brains.
Too bad an uneducated seamen can't open his head and see... ...just what he's got in it.
We're moving.
Well?
Well, Mr. Arrow?
She's breaking clear.
Haul the halyards around.
Set the jibs.
All right.
Set the topsails.
Set the guards and royals.
Belay that canary piping and tip us a man's stave.
Long John likes it.
And I likes rum, I does.
Lord, for a mouthful.
Is he serving rum aft?
The squire likes his spirits of an evening.
And he likes Valencian lace around his throat, he does.
I'm partial to Valencian lace meself.
A tender spot, the throat.
Starboard a bit, matey.
She's luffing.
She almost got away from you that time.
I was looking at old Nicodemus.
He follows us until he gets what he's after.
Well, we've given him plenty of potato peelings.
That won't do for old Nicodemus.
He's used to following slave ships.
Bless me, the ocean's full of death.
But it's cured your lungs... ...hasn't it, Long John?
Lungs, matey?
Yes, you've not coughed in a long time.
Yeah.
They're much better, more shipshape now.
What are you gonna do after this voyage?
Oh, I'll go back to that little old roof, I reckon.
Well, would you like to come and live with me?
With you, matey?
Yes.
You see, I'll have a lot more money.
And, well, I mean... ...there's only Mother and me.
And we've a nice room with a sea view... ...and sea air coming in from three sides.
And you could always be... No, no, matey.
I couldn't.
I just... Well, anyhow, you can come and visit us.
We'll always be mates, won't we?
Certain, we will.
Certain, we will.
No, matey, never spit to windward.
It'll ebb back on you.
Always spit to the leeward.
It sails like a gull.
That's right, matey.
Look, Mr. Arrow's drunk again.
The captain's got the key to the grog, Jim.
Where'd you get it?
Just seasick.
Sick?
You're drunk.
Why, sir, I haven't had a drink... You're drunk.
If it occurs again, you'll lie in the brig.
Where'd you get the rum?
Why, sir, I haven't had a drink.
You get below before I cane you.
Here, you two.
Silver, what are you doing here in the poop?
Boatswain, take this wheel.
Aye, aye.
Captain, for the lad's sake, Mr. Arrow says... To blazes with Mr. Arrow.
You get forward, where you belong.
Aye, aye, sir.
Aye, sir.
Good morning, Mr. Arrow, sir.
How's for a cup of tea this morning?
A powerful lover of tea you are, Mr. Arrow.
Yet I hopes I'm the one that serves you your last cup, sir.
Well?
He ain't nowhere aft, sir.
He ain't in the forecastle.
Poor Mr. Arrow.
And he stopped by me galley only last night, sir, for a breath of fresh air.
Still drunk, you say?
His weakness was still upon him, sir.
Old Nicodemus isn't with us anymore.
Arrow must have lurched overboard.
That settles it.
I'm sorry, sir.
This will leave you short-handed, captain.
I'll have it entered in the log.
That's all, men.
So why should I join?
Join up with what?
But, Henry, lookie... Astern of me, you little runt.
I don't like you and others of your kind who've come aboard this ship.
William... ...Henry doesn't seem happy aboard this ship.
You won't fall, Henry.
I be right here below you.
Oh, look.
Is that another shark?
Oh, no.
That's a porpoise.
That's a seaman's friend.
Look, there's a whole school of them.
They wouldn't eat anybody?
Oh, no, matey.
Porpoises off the bow is a good sign.
A successful voyage, they say.
Why, they comes right out from port and escorts you right in.
I guess nobody knows where we're heading to but the porpoises and the squire...
...I'll wager.
O'Brien, you were aloft with him.
How'd it happen?
I don't know, sir.
A bit choked up I be, sir.
Henry was my friend.
He swooned, like, and fell like a plummet.
Poor Henry.
Leastwise he'll never know what struck him.
I'm thankful for that.
Boatswain.
Aye, sir.
Prepare this body for burial.
Prepare the body for burial.
Land ho!
Land ho!
Where away?
Here, here, here.
Livesey, it's irreverent, but, damn me, come, sir.
Gray.
Where?
There it be, right under the cloud bank!
There she be.
Where?
Look, right there, underneath that cloud there.
Bless my soul.
Bless everybody's soul, matey.
It's it!
Gadzooks, Livesey, if it isn't it!
The spot seems on the side of a hill.
Rotten to the core.
Jim, run out to the apple barrel and fetch us some good ones.
My pleasure, sir.
Tomorrow, Livesey, tomorrow.
We'll land at dawn... ...and we'll have the doubloons by sundown.
You're as smart as paint to join up, Dick.
Aye, Dick listened the minute he heard there was treasure.
Don't you know the exact spot it's buried, now you're here?
Flint saw to that.
He left his ship in the same place as we're anchored.
He took the treasure and six brave lads and went ashore.
And when he came back, he came back alone.
"Dead men don't bite nor tell no tales," says he.
Well, I'm with you.
How about the others?
Oh, you mean Gray and Allan and...?
Oh, they be stupid souls.
Well, we'll talk to them.
Now, lookie, John, now we're here... ...how long are we gonna stand off and on like a blessed bumboat?
When do we strike, John?
The last minute that I can manage, that's when.
We could all steer a course for home, but who's to set one?
Captain Smollett's a good navigator, he will.
They takes the map, gets the treasure, brings it aboard.
Captain Smollett takes us out into the trade winds... ...and then one day, they all disappear overboard.
Result of a very heavy storm at sea.
Like Flint ye be, John.
And the flower of the flock was Flint.
Hey, Dick, you're a nice lad.
Get me an apple out of that barrel to sweeten my pipe with, will you?
Silver.
Silver.
Silver.
George Merry and the others is breaking out arms.
Now, I told them you was against it.
Why, the fools.
Aye.
This molasses is sweeter than Silver said it'd be.
Ephraim, look-see if that box of prunes don't turn into powder and ball.
Who smuggled these arms aboard this ship?
I did.
I'll tell you when to break them out.
And that's the whole awful story, sir.
I wish I'd only dreamt it.
There's your lighthearted crew for you.
Captain Smollett, I own myself an utter ass.
I await your orders.
What beats me is how they've been held in check so remarkably.
With your permission, captain, that's Silver.
A very remarkable man.
Yes, he'd look remarkably well swinging from a yardarm, sir.
Easy, Jim.
Steady, boy.
You may have been the means of saving the lot of us.
Don't flounder now.
I'm not afraid.
Let's see, there are seven of us, including young Hawkins here.
We were nine.
What's the first move?
Silver's anxious to conceal everything and hold on.
I'm anxious to give him the chance.
So we'll send the crew ashore alone.
It's my idea they'll be glad to go.
Think they'll bark their shins on the treasure.
If they all go, we up anchor and run with the ship.
If none go, we'll try and hold this cabin, and God defend the right.
Redruth, you load and distribute those muskets.
If only a few go ashore... ...you mark my word, Silver will bring them back, as mild as lambs.
Come and get your sidearms, gentlemen.
Come on, Jim.
You can spy out a lot more for us.
Exactly, boy.
They trust you.
Why, you and Silver have been great friends.
I know.
Why, we were mates, and we were gonna hunt goats together.
I even asked him to live with me.
He was the best friend I knew.
He gave me this.
I never knew anybody like him before.
But I know him now.
Certain, I do.
Ship's cook means luck ashore, mates.
Shove off, lads.
Silver has left six men.
One of them might be honest.
Jim!
Who told you to come along?
Well, nobody.
I just... Hey, what?
Jim!
Come here.
Wait for me, matey.
Jim?
You hear me?
Jim!
You come back here!
Hunter, did Jim go ashore?
Why, yes, sir.
I thought it was part of the plan, sir.
Gentlemen, this is bad business.
Now, come now, Tom.
You haul to and think it over.
What are you telling me, John Silver?
I'll not listen to the likes of that.
Now, be off.
I don't want my rigging fouled with mutiny.
I'm an honest seaman, you hear?
Yeah, I'll lay to that... ...but, Tom, you're smart as paint.
Why, I knew that the minute I clapped eyes on you.
You ain't gonna let honesty stand in the way of being smart, are you?
In heaven's name, what was that?
That?
I reckon that be Allan.
So you killed Allan, have you?
Well, rest his soul for a true seaman.
But kill me if you can.
I defies you.
That's two.
Not Jim.
They wouldn't do...
They'll do anything now.
Our only chance is to... Stay below there, you men.
Get back in that hold.
We've got to abandon ship.
Load the jollyboat with all the provisions and powder she'll carry.
You men get that boat in the water and get it loaded up.
Why abandon ship?
They've shown their hand.
When they come back, they'll board it.
They've killed two men already.
We're next.
Can't we hold them off?
With these swine at our backs?
If we tried to hold that aft cabin, they'd burn it.
We've got to get to Flint's blockhouse.
If that stockade is still standing, we can at least make a fight of it.
Gray!
Abraham Gray!
We're about to leave this ship.
I think you're an honest man.
If you wanna do your duty, come out and follow me.
I'm with you, sir.
Good man.
Lay aft and help with the boat.
Aye, sir.
Don't shoot.
Don't shoot.
Who are you?
I'm Ben Gunn.
I'm poor old Ben Gunn.
And I haven't spoken to a Christian these three years.
Three years?
Were you shipwrecked?
Nay, mate.
Marooned.
Marooned three years agone.
And I lived on oysters and berries and goats.
My heart's sore for Christian diet.
You mightn't happen to have a piece of cheese about you, now?
No.
"No," says you?
Well, says I, many a long night I dreamed of cheese.
It's toasted, mostly.
Then I wake up again, and here I were.
Well, if I ever get aboard again, you shall have some.
Well, now, what's to hinder you getting aboard now?
Ain't old Flint's ship, be it?
Oh, no.
Flint's dead.
But most of his hands are aboard her.
Worse luck for us.
Not a one-legged man?
You mean Silver?
If you was sent by Long John, I'm just the same as pork, and I know it.
But who are the rest you spoke about, matey?
Well, there's Dr. Livesey and Squire Trelawney and the captain.
Squires and doctors, says you?
Gentlemen born, says I.
That's different.
Have they showed themselves ashore yet?
No.
Lively, doctor, lively!
This is the last trip.
So after I was on Flint's ship, I was on another ship.
That was three years back, and we spied this island.
"Lads," says I, "there's where old Flint's treasure's buried.
Let's land and find it."
Twelve days we hunts.
Every day they have worse words for me.
Till one fine morning, all hands got aboard.
"As for you, Benjamin Gunn," says they... ..."you're so sure Flint's treasure's buried here... ...you can just stay and find it," says they.
"Now, was that a gentlemanly thing to do," says you?
Well, did you find it?
That's what your squires and doctors would like to know, says I.
"Yes," says you?
Snug in behind that rock, Jim, is my little skin boat and paddle... ...as I made it with my own hands.
You takes it, paddles out, finds the squire and tells him... ...that Ben Gunn puts a heap sight more confidence... ...heap sight, mind you... ...in gentlemen born than gentlemen of fortune.
And then you nips him on the cheek like I does you.
Why?
And then you tells him... ...that Ben Gunn will meet him on this hill.
He's to come alone with a white thing in his hand.
Upon my word, I don't know what you're talking about... ...but I'll tell the squire and doctor everything that you said.
They've be...
They've begun to fight.
Who's the best shot here?
Mr. Trelawney, out and away.
Pick me off one of those pirates, if you please, sir.
Move sharply, move sharply.
There.
Hand me that ball.
That's a score snood!
Come on, my boys.
Stay to your oars, Gray.
He's gone.
We've got to beach this boat or she'll swamp.
Larboard.
Larboard a little.
We're swamped here, lads.
Hold to your muskets.
Jim, thank heaven you're safe.
Up, lads.
Abandon that boat.
Stockade's our only chance.
It's them after-cabin blokes!
They're making for the stockade.
Come on, lads, head them off.
Belay that.
Belay that, you swabs!
They'll shoot you down like a lot of gulls.
Get to those gigs and get back to that ship.
Come on, lads.
Shoot away, me lads.
That's the way to waste powder.
The flag spots the house for them.
Hadn't we better lower it?
Lower the flag?
Strike my colors?
Not I, sir.
We've little provisions, but we've plenty of powder and ball.
And by heaven, sir, this spot is England.
Stockade, ahoy!
It's Silver himself.
I feel this may be a trick.
Doctor, take charge of your watch.
Gray.
Joyce.
What do you want with your flag of truce?
Captain Silver, sir, wants to come aboard to make terms.
Captain Silver?
Who's he?
I never heard of him.
Me, sir.
Me.
The poor lads have chosen me their captain since your desertion, sir.
What's your course, Silver?
One minute's talk with you.
I've no desire to talk with you.
If you wanna come over here, come.
But if there's any treachery, it'll be on your side, and Lord help you.
That word from you is enough, sir.
I knows a gentleman when I lays eyes on him, you can lay to that.
Joyce, take the doctor's place.
Well, well, well.
Here we are all together again, just like one big, happy family.
Top of the morning to you, Jim.
I'd rather you'd sit down, Silver.
Sit down and toss away that crutch if you're talking to me.
Come, out with it, man.
What do you want?
We want the treasure.
We're gonna have it.
You want your lives, that's yours.
Well, you can have that if you give us Flint's chart.
I'd see you and the whole island blown to blazes first.
Well, that... That's an idea.
You give me the chart... ...and the moment the treasure's onboard, we'll take you along with it.
And I'll give you my affidavit, upon my word and honor... ...that we'll set you down safe and sound at the first point of civilization.
That's on your word of honor.
My affidavit, gentlemen.
And a handsomer one you couldn't hope to look at.
That all?
Every last word, by thunder.
Good.
Now you hear me.
You come back here, one by one, unarmed... ...and I'll guarantee to put you in irons, take you to England and get you a fair trial.
If you refuse, my name is Alexander Smollett...
...I've flown my sovereign's colors... ...and I'll see you all to Davy Jones.
That final?
That's the last good word... ...you'll hear out of me, by heaven.
The next time we meet, I'll put a bullet in you.
Do you meet my terms?
No.
Then tumble out of here, me lad.
Hand over hand, on the double.
Give me a hand up.
I'd sooner touch carrion.
Who'll give me a hand up?
Before the hour's up, I'll crush your blockhouse... ...like it was a puncheon.
Them of you that dies will be lucky.
Inside.
Clear decks for action.
Quarters, all hands.
They'll board us in a minute.
Now, get over that wall first, and don't use your muskets only as the last resort.
Morgan, you and yours to the larboard.
Job, you and yours to the starboard.
Now, by the powers, board them.
Here they come, captain!
Fire when they top the wall.
Another load, Jim.
More loads, Hawkins.
Come, boy.
Trelawney, sir, you're a man.
And you're a captain, sir.
At them, you dogfish!
At them!
Outside, lads.
Outside and fight them in the open.
Cutlasses.
Lively, lively, lads.
My compliments, Mr. Gray.
I've been looking for this.
Inside the house, lads.
They've gone.
Fire from cover.
You crawling squid.
You dogfish.
Don't mind me, sir.
Watch them.
They've turned tail for the moment.
My case, Jim.
Hunter and Joyce are dead, sir.
My case, Jim.
Captain Smollett has a ball in his shoulder.
Oh, yes.
God rest Hunter and Joyce.
Amen.
How many did they lose?
Seven.
They've had their rations for today.
Well, that makes them nine against our five, gentlemen.
Precious sight more confidence, eh?
Yes, sir.
Here's Gray.
Well?
Well, Gray?
They're all camped down by the swamp.
I heard them.
They're like hornets, and Silver's the maddest.
It looks like tomorrow will finish us.
What's in the wind?
They're building rafts and floating the cannon in from the ship.
Silver says he's going to blow this blockhouse to limbo.
That settles it.
This Ben Gunn may be our last chance.
You sure he's all right in the head?
Well, he's rather silly, sir.
He told me to nip the squire.
Nip me?
How?
Begging your pardon, sir, like this.
A lunatic.
No harm in finding out.
I have two hours before dawn.
I'll haunt that clearing all day.
It'll take them all day to get that gun ashore.
If they turn up again, God be with you, gentlemen.
Godspeed, doctor.
Good luck, doctor.
What's the doctor up to?
Oh, he thinks this Ben Gunn fellow can help us.
How is beyond me.
Says he, says them, says I, says nothing.
We can't hold out against cannon, Smollett.
If we could only get out and cut that ship adrift... ...that'd put an end to the cannon.
Cut off their base of supplies.
We've no boat.
They're undoubtedly watching the gigs.
I know, I know.
The doctor's right.
Our only chance is this Gunn fellow.
Keep near the house, Jim.
Oh, yes, sir.
It's just hot in here, sir.
Go on, make your play.
Make your play, I says!
Let's talk.
Silver's tangled everything, I tell you.
Stow that drunken guff and make your play.
I be'n't drunk, and Silver's a fool.
You're the fool, William.
And your face fair makes me bilious, it does.
Fool, bilious, eh?
We're adrift!
Adrift we be!
Why, the anchor's gone!
The hawser's parted!
Up with the jib, we'll swing into the reef.
Come aboard, Mr.
Hands.
Much hurt?
Not the way poor dear William be.
He wasn't much of a sailor, was William.
Where might you come from?
I've come aboard to take possession of this ship, Mr.
Hands... ...and you can regard me as captain until further notice.
Well, now, Captain Hawkins... ...and who's to sail her, without you get the hint from me?
Well... Now, look here... ...you give me me food and me drink... ...and a bit of a scarf or a handkerchief to bind up me wound with... ...and I'll show you how to sail her.
Now, that's square all round, ain't it?
Done, Mr.
Hands.
Now, I can't have these colors, Mr.
Hands... ...and by your leave, I'll strike them.
God save the king, and there's an end to Captain Silver.
Now your wound, Mr.
Hands.
I won't be forgetting about this, Captain Hawkins.
And where might we be a-sailing to?
Not back to the anchorage, you can be sure.
I've seen a map of this island.
Do you know a cove called North Inlet?
That I do.
It's a way north, on the other shore, it be.
Well, that's where we're sailing to.
I'm gonna run her high and dry on the beach... ...where nobody will be able to find her excepting honest people.
Now, does that suit your curiosity, Mr.
Hands?
Why, Captain Hawkins, under my present unfortunate circumstances... ...to a plum.
Aye, she's headed right now.
Right, captain.
Now lash the wheel and come forward for a close haul on the jib.
Right.
It's been a tiresome voyage.
Why, you can stand.
And I can walk too.
Perhaps you'll be needing a little rest, Captain Hawkins.
Wet powder, Captain Hawkins.
One more step, Mr.
Hands, and I'll blow your brains out.
Dead men don't bite, you know.
I reckon you and me will have to sign articles, Jim.
I'd have had you but for that lurch there.
I don't have much luck, not I.
It looks like I'll have to... Dr. Livesey.
Dr. Livesey.
Pieces of eight.
Well, if it ain't Jim Hawkins.
Dropped in sort of friendly-like, huh?
What have you done with my friends?
Have you killed them?
Oh, no.
Blood spilling's all over, Jim.
We signed a treaty, Jim.
Treaty?
What kind of a treaty?
Well, we give them their freedom out of here in return for half of their provisions.
But where did they go?
Oh, they just wandered away.
But if you're of mind to hunting them up, why, you just save your time, Jim... ...because they don't want to have nothing to do with you.
You're lying.
No, Jim.
Why, the squire told me right to my face that you was a deserter... ...and the doctor... Oh, the doctor said that you was scared.
But they couldn't think that.
They wouldn't, not after...
Naturally, I've always wanted you to join up with us and take your share.
Now it looks like you'll have to.
Well, supposing I said no.
Well, even if you do get the treasure... ...your ship's lost, your men lost, your whole business gone to wreck.
If you want to know who did it, it was I.
You, Jim?
I was in the apple barrel that night and heard you.
I cut the ship's hawser and killed those two aboard her... ...and I took her where you'll never see her again, none of you.
Kill me if you want, but the laugh's on my side, and I'll die laughing at the lot of you.
I believe you would, matey.
He faked the map from Billy Bones.
First and last we've been fouled by him.
Avast there!
Be you captain here, Morgan?
Tom's right.
I'm the captain...
...I say what's right.
I'll be hanged if I'll be hazed by you, John... You want to have it out with me?
That's better, George Merry.
Why, this boy's got more fight in him than the whole of you.
I like this boy... ...and if you understand King George's English... ...you better not lay a hand on him.
Well, you makes a hash of this cruise.
You're a bold man to say no to that.
And second, there's that boy.
He's earned a proper killing.
In the third place, you wouldn't let us attack them, and they on the march.
And fourth, you let the enemy out of this trap for nothing.
Oh, we get the stores and the powder... ...but we didn't get the map, did we?
And what do we want here except for the map, I'd like to know.
Quiet, by George!
By thunder, it's it.
Look: "J.F."
Flint's initials, with a score below and a clove hitch.
Good old Silver!
Long John forever!
Aye, Silver!
Hurrah for Silver.
Where'd you get the map?
From Dr. Livesey, matey.
You couldn't have gotten it unless you killed them.
No.
That's part of the bargain, matey.
They gets their freedom and we gets the treasure.
Will you join me in a bit of fresh air, matey?
There's so much stupidity in here that I can't breathe properly.
Come on.
Guess that ends everything, now that you've got the map.
No, matey, you've still got a chance for a share.
No, I thank you... ...but I want you to know I'm grateful for you defending me.
Now I best go and hunt up my friends.
Goodbye.
Here, you better stay here for a spell.
Maybe the squire and the doctor have had a little change of heart about you.
Well, yes, but... Well, I might need you for a hostage.
Come on, sit down.
Hostage?
What do you need a hostage for?
You said you'd made a treaty.
Well, treaties are only good until you find a chance to break them, matey.
That isn't very honorable.
It's smart, Jim.
You see what being honorable done for me?
I had to show them the map, didn't I?
Well, why were you keeping it from them?
There's too many of them to share the treasure with.
I just trying to figure a way to get rid of about half of them.
Oh, I see.
More murders.
Oh, no, not murder.
Tactics.
I recall taking a prize ship off of Peru once... ...and there was too many of them to share the treasure with... ...so Flint and me, we waits till all hands are asleep...
I don't wish to hear about it.
All right, Jim.
Well, what did you do with them?
Flint, he has a little hammer, so we go around to all the bunks... ...and we get in back of the men and then we... Never mind.
I don't wish to hear about it.
Oh, all right.
It ain't important.
We only disposed of 13 men.
Blockhouse, ahoy.
What about it, Silver?
Have you seen anything of Jim Hawkins?
Why...
Here I am, Dr. Livesey.
Thank heaven you're safe.
Let me talk with him.
No, by the powers.
They'll pull a trick.
Please.
I'll be telling you for the last time, George Merry, you drop his arm.
You give me your word of honor that you won't slip your cable, Jim?
I do.
Well, all right, then.
We'll go down and have a yarn with the good doctor.
Dr. Livesey.
Where did you all go?
Why did you give up to them?
All I can tell you now is that we're safe and sound.
But where did you go, lad?
We searched everywhere.
Then you didn't think I deserted you, sir, and that I was scared?
Not a thought of it, lad.
You said that they said I was scared, that they didn't want me.
Well, matey, I thought it would be easier for you to join up that way.
Oh, I didn't join, sir.
Truly, I didn't.
But where did you go, Jim?
What...?
I ran away to cut the ship's hawser, like Captain Smollett wanted.
I have her beached at North Inlet now, sir.
North Inlet, eh?
Float her and get her away from here.
Don't mind about me.
One budge of your hand, Silver, and I fire.
Quick, now.
Quick, Jim.
Whip over the wall and run for it.
Oh, no, sir, I passed my word... What's your word to these scoundrels?
Quick, head for cover.
Sir, it was my word of honor, no matter whom it's to.
I can't break it.
A lad of honor.
I counted on that, sir.
Jim, we won't leave this island without you, my word on that.
You're going for the treasure now, eh?
There where we be going.
Well, mark you, Silver: When you find it, prepare for squalls.
And if Jim Hawkins here is so much as scratched... ...there'll be a ball between your eyes that nobody will bother to remove.
Squalls, eh, matey?
Am I off my course and sitting on a waterspout?
I'd almost wager.
East-southeast... ...two points east.
I thought so.
Just as the chart says.
Why, that's one of the six brave lads that Flint killed... ...and laid their bones right in a line with the treasure.
There's five more of them ahead between us and the doubloons.
Forward.
Darby McGraw!
Darby McGraw!
Hark, ye.
Darby McGraw!
Darby McGraw!
That's him, I tell you.
I've heard Flint calling Darby a hundred times.
Fetch aft the rum!
Them was his last words aboveboard.
That fixes it.
I'm done.
Where might I hear that voice afore?
Nobody but us on this island knows them words.
That's Flint's spirit.
Nothing but flesh and blood can talk.
I was never afeard of Flint alive, and I ain't scared to face him dead.
Come on, if you're coming.
There it be, mates, right in the clearing there.
At it, mates.
All together.
Why, there's nothing there at all.
Nothing, Jim.
We've been out-sailed.
Here, Jim.
Take that and stand by for trouble.
Two guineas.
That's your 700,000 pounds, is it?
Why don't you dig a little deeper, lads.
Maybe you'll find radishes and turnips.
It's only an old cripple and a boy.
Let's settle it.
Let them have it.
That'll hold them for good and all, Gray.
Dr. Livesey, where did you come from?
How did you happen...?
We thought we'd be useful, Jim.
Look, sir, there's no treasure at all.
We've come all this way and everybody's been killed for nothing.
Upon my word, sir, I don't understand it.
Well, don't try, Jim.
We'll go up to Ben Gunn's cave.
Maybe old Ben's got another trick in his beard.
Beard?
Cave?
Upon my word, sir.
Thank ye kindly, doctor, and quite a squall it were.
By the powers.
That voice.
So it be you, Ben Gunn.
How do you do, Mr. Silver?
"Pretty well, I thank you," says you.
Ben, Ben.
To think as you've done me.
Gray, lead the way with Jim.
March, Silver.
You'll find as how you've been done by everybody.
Well, have you had enough action, me lad?
No, thank you.
Keep going, keep going.
Why, bless my soul...
But... What's...?
Upon my soul, how did it all get here?
All found and carried up here with my own hands, says I.
"Very thoughtful," says you?
And you can be full of cheese from now on, says I.
"Yes," says you?
Yes, says I.
Be it all here, Ben Gunn?
You don't be holding out any on us, now, be you?
Mr. Silver, says I.
Silver.
Aye, aye, sir.
Well, captain, I reports back to duty.
Me and Jim played a powerful trick on them.
Now that we all have the treasure, why, we're all one big, happy family.
We've got the treasure.
We.
You're going back to stand trial in England for mutiny and murder, my man.
Look, Jim.
Rubies with fire in them.
Them's pretty harsh measures.
Pretty strong medicine, captain, for just a little infraction of the rules.
Not nearly so harsh or strong... ...as the rope I hope to see you hanging from at Execution Dock.
You're under arrest, Silver.
'Hispaniola' ahoy!
Ahoy!
Ahoy!
Don't leave me!
Don't leave me, I'll stand trial!
We'll starve.
We'll starve!
You had your chance, my friends.
We'll pick up a new crew at Jamaica.
Did the frigate answer our signal?
She says, "Come aboard, Hampton commanding."
Good.
Ben Gunn, stay alert, now.
We want no strange craft alongside.
Aye, sir.
A British ship of the line.
And tomorrow we may have the pleasure of seeing Silver... ...hanging to a yardarm.
Well, Jim, do you come to take old John aloft for a breather?
No.
I fetched you this instead.
Thank ye, matey, but I ain't much for spirits.
Well, I thought you might like to start and drink a lot of it.
Why?
Well, doesn't everybody?
I mean, before they're hanged?
Hanged, matey?
They went over to a frigate that's lying here.
They're not gonna wait till we get to England.
Captain says we can hold a naval trial tomorrow... ...and the squire says we can see you swinging from a yardarm.
That ain't just exactly a breather, be it, Jim?
I'm sorry.
Truly, I am.
You say they all went over?
No, they left Ben Gunn on watch.
Well, Jim...
...I guess you'll have to stand on deck and watch me swing.
I can't bear the thought of it.
Of you, of anybody.
Oh, we won't think about that, Jim.
You just dies, and that's that.
Quite often, though, not as quick as people think, Jim.
Why not?
Well... ...you take my case, as it were.
Now, there I'll be, way out on that yardarm.
Way out there with a rope around my neck.
And then they gives the orders to jump.
And when the average man jumps and reaches the end of that rope... ...snaps his head around, way around like that.
That's the average man.
But of course, with me, it's a little bit different.
With my one leg, you see, I'd be kind of off-balance.
And if they didn't get that noose just right... ...right there, why, I'd probably just... ...slowly strangle and choke... ...just so I didn't swallow my tongue.
But that very rarely happens, Jim, swallowing the tongue.
Stop, stop!
There.
I don't know how you'll get by Ben Gunn... ...but you're free from here, at least.
Oh, that's my matey.
If ever the day comes that I can help you, why, I...
I'm going to... What's the matter?
I guess you'll have to help me up, matey.
It's my rheumatism.
This place is damp in here.
No, no, no.
I'm ticklish under my arm.
Thank ye, matey, thank ye.
Where's Ben Gunn?
Sitting up by the mizzenmast on guard.
You run aft and get me a pistol.
No, there'll be no blood spilled in this.
Oh, no, not for Ben Gunn.
Why, I can talk with Ben, he and me are old shipmates.
Just for protection on shore, you know.
It's a wild place, Jamaica.
All right.
But I told you, you mustn't.
Now, ain't that terrible?
He's left to guard a ship, and there he lays in a drunken stupor.
But he has a awful large bump on his head.
Well, he must have got that when he fell off of there... ...and hit the deck with his head.
Ain't that too bad.
Well, matey... What old Long John's got to tell you, he don't know how to say it.
I don't mean that you'll be forgiving me all the bad things that I've done... ...but just for the mateys that we might have been.
You won't be a pirate anymore, will you?
You won't steal?
No, sir.
From now on... ...my course is going to be a straight, honest one, so help me.
Why, shiver my timbers, I... Well, now, I'm glad that happened, matey.
That's just what I was trying to tell you, and I didn't know how.
I cut through the bulkhead, into where the treasure was... ...and took off just one sack of gold.
But you promised you wouldn't.
Well, I took that before I promised.
But it's off my conscience now... ...and the Lord knows my conscience won't stand any more, matey.
Well, here.
You may need it.
No, no, no, thanks.
But you have to buy food.
No, that's all right, Jim.
I'll get along all right.
I'll get along all right.
Well, matey...
Here.
Feed her good.
And put her... You put her down below decks when any women around, huh?
I will.
I promise I will.
Oh, belay that.
Don't do that.
Our courses will cross again sometime.
Lookie.
Lookie, now.
Now, you didn't get all of that bar silver on that island, now, did you?
No.
Well, who knows?
Maybe someday you'll have a great big ship.
Bigger than this one.
And you'll go down there and get the rest of that treasure, now, won't you?
And you might be needing a mate or a captain, huh?
I guess so.
All right.
And who do you think would come hobbling along for that berth... ...but old Long John Silver?
It'd be Honest Long John then.
And together, we'd go down there and dig up that treasure... ...and we'd scour all the seas for all the treasures on those islands.
And we'd hunt goats.
And fight cannibals.
It's true, matey.
Certain, we will.
Certain, we will.
The squire and Dr. Livesey... ... having asked me to write down the particulars of Treasure Island... ... leaving nothing out but the bearings of the island itself... ... and that only because there is still treasure not yet lifted.
I go back to the time when my mother and I kept the Admiral Benbow Inn... ... and the brown, old seaman with a saber cut... ... first took up lodging under our roof.
Open the door, will you?
Open the door!
Go away!
We're closed.
Open the door, you lubberly swab, or by thundering...
Throw that cutlass away this instant.
What do you want?
Good evening, missus.
Lad.
Will you not put up your musket?
I'm just a simple sailor seeking lodgings.
Just so?
This looks like a conveniently situated grogshop.
You have much company here, lad, do you?
No, sir.
No one hardly ever comes in here since Father died.
Shh.
Ha, ha.
Then this here's the place for me, matey.
And what might we call you, sir?
If we're to put up with the likes of you under our roof.
You may call me captain, ma'am.
Captain Billy Bones at your service.
I'm a plain man, ma'am.
Rum, bacon and bread's what I want.
And that headland down the road there to watch ships off of.
Here, matey.
Tell me when I've worked my way through that, will you?
He stayed with us long after his gold had run out.
But none of us had the courage to ask for more.
All day, he hung around the cove or upon the cliffs with a brass telescope... ... gazing out over the waves... ... as if he feared something were coming for him from the sea.
All evening, he would drink rum and water very strong... ... looking up fierce when spoken to.
His stories and songs were all about hanging and piracy... ... and wild deeds on the Spanish Main.
None of us suspected then, of course... ... how our lives would be changed by them forever.
Jim, here.
Have you seen a seafaring man... ...with one leg, Jim?
No, sir.
Keep a weather eye open, Jim, for a seafaring man.
I will give you a silver fourpenny each week, you understand that?
Aye.
See, you've told me, captain, but I haven't seen one yet.
Dr. Livesey.
Hello, Jim.
Ah.
Dr. Livesey.
Good evening, Mrs. Hawkins.
Evening, doctor.
And how are you feeling, Mrs. Hawkins?
Better, I trust.
Oh, yes, doctor.
Thanks to your visit.
Fifteen men on a dead man's chest Drink to the devil And had done for the rest Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum Give me rum, you hear?
Give us rum, goddamn you!
Rum, it's feed and drink to the likes of me!
Rum, good laddie.
Mrs. Hawkins, I once prescribed a draft for Squire Trelawney.
He had the gout, you know.
And his man, Joyce, swore he would see him take it.
But the squire...
Silence!
Silence between decks to here.
Were you addressing me, sir?
I was indeed, sir.
Have you something to say about that?
I have only one thing to say to you, sir.
If you keep on drinking rum... ...the world will soon be quit of a very dirty scoundrel.
You're a whistler.
Captain.
I'll take none of that from the likes of you, nor any other lubberly swab.
You call me "captain" or I'm gonna pin you to the wall with this cutlass... ...and hang you from the yard by your thumbs and use you for musket practice.
Now, you hear me.
If you do not put down that cutlass this instant...
...I promise you, upon my honor, that I'll have you drawn up at the next assizes.
Ha!
I am not a doctor only, but a magistrate.
And now I know there is such a fellow in my district.
And if I catch so much as a breath of complaint against you...
...I'll have you hunted down and hanged like the dog you are.
Let that suffice.
Well, I say, Mrs. Hawkins, the squire is a clever fellow.
What might I get for you, sir?
Rum, sonny.
Rum will do.
Is this here a table for my mate, Bill?
I don't know your mate Bill, sir.
This table's for the captain.
Ah.
Right, because now Bill would be called "captain," aye.
Now... ...is my mate, Bill, in this here house?
No, sir.
He's out walking.
Back soon?
Yes, sir.
Where's your mother, boy?
She's not here.
She's in the village.
To market.
Just as well.
All right.
This'll be a pleasant surprise for my mate, Bill.
Good as drink.
You know, I have a young nipper of my own.
It's like you is two blocks.
And he's all the pride of my yards.
But a great thing for boys... ...is discipline.
Discipline?
Aye.
Discipline.
Right.
Would you step in here and surprise old Bill.
Billy Bones.
Come, Bill, you know your old shipmate, surely.
Black Dog?
Aye.
Black Dog as ever was.
Come for to see his old mate, Bill.
Now, look here.
You've run me down here.
Here I am.
Now, what you want, Dog?
You speak up, will you?
Ah?
That's you, Bill.
I'll just have a glass of rum from this dear child here.
You'll join me, won't you?
Now, we'll sit down and talk square, like old shipmates.
Where's the chart, Bill?
No.
No, no!
We'll swing.
Swing once, swing all, say I.
That weren't Flint's way, no sir.
Flint's dead, God damn him.
Aye.
Aye.
That he is, mate, dead and damned.
All I want's the chart, Bill.
All I'm asking's what's rightfully ours.
Our lawful shares.
Damn your lawful shares and damn you too.
Rum, Jim.
Rum, boy.
Oh, God.
Are you hurt?
It's rum I need, Jim.
Give us rum, will you?
Ah.
I needed that.
I must get away from here, Jim, before they have the black spot on me.
That black what?
Spot, Jim.
It's a summons.
The lubbers will be going around by now to get their wind of me.
What lubbers are those, captain?
Ah, it's Flint's men, as like as not.
Black Dog, Blind Pew.
It's my old sea chest they're after, macky.
Now, you look here, Jim.
If they should slip me the spot, you get on a horse... ...and you go and fetch that infernal swab of a doctor.
You tell him why I'm the only one that has it.
Has what?
Oh.
Flint gave it to me as he was lying, dying in some island.
For the love of God, boy, give me some rum, will you?
Will you?
Who's there?
Jim Hawkins.
What do you want?
Would some kind friend tell a poor, blind man... ...what's lost the sight of his eyes in the service of King George, God bless him... ...in what part of the country he might now be?
You're at the Admiral Benbow Inn.
Oh, yes.
Give me your hand, my kind young friend.
Lead me in.
Now, boy, you take me to the captain.
I daren't.
You take me in straight, and as soon as I'm in view, you cries out.
Here's a friend of yours, Bill.
Yes, yes, oh, yes.
Captain Bones.
Blind Pew.
Yes.
Come for you at last, Billy.
Now... ...business is business, Mr. Bones.
Sit right where you are.
Hold out your hand.
Boy, take his left hand and bring it near my right.
Yes.
And now that's done.
Oh, yes.
It's a spot, Jim.
It's the black spot, lad.
"You have till 10:00."
That's two hours.
We'll have them yet, Jim.
Get me a top of rum, will you?
Here, lad, it's...
It's for the sea chest.
For the old sea chest, boy.
What chest?
Mother.
What's been happening here, Jim?
Is he dead?
Aye, dead.
Being in his cups again, I shouldn't wonder.
Now, what about this chest?
He owes me money.
Mother, the captain said we have the devil to pay and no pitch hot.
They tipped him the black spot.
That what?
Stop talking nonsense and open the chest.
If there's money in there, we'll have what's own us and no more.
Mother, listen to me, please.
They're coming for him at 10.
It's almost 10 now.
Who's coming, Jim?
The lubbers.
They're coming for the captain.
They can have him.
That's broken.
What lubbers?
Blind Pew and Black Dog.
Flint's men.
The captain said they were after his sea chest.
Said he was the only one had it.
Had what?
Aha!
We'll have what he owes us and not a penny more.
Mother, we must go to the village and get Sheriff Dance.
Shh.
What's that?
Blind Pew.
He's come back.
Come on, Mother.
They'll cut our throats.
Come on, Jim.
No!
No!
Let him go.
No, you leave him.
No.
No.
Get out.
Jim.
Quickly, come on.
Jim.
Come on.
It won't open.
It won't open, Jim.
No.
No!
Stop it.
Mother!
Shake his...
It's Billy.
Someone's done for it.
Search him.
Run for the woods.
He's been overhauled already.
Aloft.
Find the chest.
There's the chest.
The lady, you shucking lubbers.
Catch the boy.
He's got it, you fools.
Pew, they've ransacked the bloody thing.
It's gone.
So's the money.
And the money.
Come below and follow the boy.
All I want's to put his eyes out.
Scatter and find them.
They can't have gone far.
What the devil?
Hey, who's that?
Sheriff Dance.
Hey, let's go there, lads.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Black Dog, don't.
Israel.
You won't leave old Pew, mate.
Not old Pew.
Damn your eyes.
No.
Leave him like that.
After them.
Aye, aye, sir.
After them.
Get up there.
Oh, dear.
Sheriff Dance saw a scooner standing off and on in the cove.
Rather suspicious.
He reported it to me.
Drink that.
I said we should roust up his men and ride hard for the Admiral Benbow.
It were a lucky chance we came when we did.
It were none too soon either.
They got the money, I presume.
They did not.
Excuse me, doctor.
Yes, Jim?
I don't think they're after the money.
What in fortune were they after then?
I think they were after this.
It should be put in a safe place.
To be sure, boy.
Quite right.
We must go at once to Squire Trelawney and open it in his presence.
He'll know what to do.
Jim, there's not a moment to lose.
Can you ride?
I tell you, I have some business with the squire.
Wake him up.
No.
You must do it.
We must wake him up.
Please do it.
Please?
Thank you.
Livesey.
Squire.
Well, where is it?
Come on, man.
Hawkins, you had quite the night, I hear.
Yes, sir.
Your coffee, sir.
Thank you, Joyce.
Hot and hot.
Squire?
Scotch, Livesey?
Yeah, okay.
Master Hawkins?
That'll do, Joyce.
Uh, milk, sir?
All right.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Uh, sugar, sir?
No.
That'll do, Joyce.
Yes, sir.
Well, now, squire.
First of all, we'll try the book.
Yes.
"W. Burns, master's mate.
Off Palm Quay, he got it."
Some sort of an account.
"Bones his pile."
Can't make head nor tail of this.
Oh, Livesey, this is as plain as noon to a seafaring man.
This is the black-hearted scoundrel's account book.
Look, here.
Now, look here.
This is a list of the town's sacked or the ship's voyage... ...and here, the sums of Bone's share of the loot.
Right you are.
You see what it is to be a traveler.
Now, and the other... Treasure Island.
Bulk of treasure here.
Oh, God.
It must be... "Tall tree, Spyglass shoulder, bearing north northeast by north.
Skeleton Island, east southeast and by east.
Ten feet.
The bar sil...
The bar silver is in the north cache... ...at 10 fathom south of black crag.
Signed J. F." For God's love, man.
You know what this is?
Pray enlighten me, sir.
J. F. John Flint.
This is Flint's map.
Bulk of treasure here.
That's Flint's treasure, man.
Who's this Flint?
Billy Bones said he was Flint's first mate.
He was the blood-thirstiest buccaneer that ever sailed.
Well, Blackbeard was a child of Flint.
Ha, ha.
Even the Spaniard was so prodigiously afraid of him.
I must own, I was proud he was an Englishman.
Sir, would this treasure be worth much?
Worth mu...?
Worth much.
Ha, ha.
Why, lad, here's the sight of it.
I shall fit out a shipping in Bristol dock within two weeks.
The finest vessel in England... ...and then we'll sail for the Spanish Main within a month.
You, Hawkins, shall come aboard as cabin boy.
Livesey here shall be surgeon, and myself, admiral, of course.
And then we'll take along Joyce, my man and, oh, great... Well, that's capital, squire, capital, but there's only one man I'm afraid of.
Name the dog.
You, sir.
For you cannot hold your tongue, as well you know.
We aren't the only men to know about this.
From first to last, none of us must breathe a word.
Well, you're in the right of it, doctor, as usual.
You may depend upon me.
I shall be as silent as a grave.
Goodbye, Jim.
Now, you take care of yourself.
And mind you, do what your squire tells you.
Jim.
Bye, Mother.
The doctor and old Redruth, the squire's gamekeeper... ... came for me at dusk on the Bristol mail.
Next morning, we had turned the corner, my home was out of sight.
And in no time at all, Bristol laid bustling before us.
What is that?
Come on, lad.
The squire will keelhaul us if we're late.
Oh, Redruth, stop dawdling, man.
Come on.
Stay away.
There she is, Jim.
The Hispaniola.
Bring the bag, Redruth.
Ahoy, Hispaniola!
Ahoy, on boat!
Come on.
Welcome aboard the Hispaniola, doctor.
You're late.
Better late than never, admiral.
The roads were muddy, sir.
We got stuck three times on the way to Bristol.
Did you?
Did you?
Yes, come on, Redruth, come on.
Don't hang back, man.
Mr. Arrow, here, look after your tonnage.
Aye, aye, sir.
Will you take a glass of port with me in my cabin?
Nothing would please me better, sir.
So when do we sail?
Sail?
We sail tomorrow, boy.
Ha, ha.
To the good ship Hispaniola, gentleman.
A sweeter ship you could not imagine.
I give you joy over her, sir.
To the Hispaniola.
Hispaniola.
Mm.
A child could sail her, doctor.
You know, I had a devil of a job finding a crew for her.
Hard to find half a dozen who knew the difference... ...between the main top and the keelson.
Are there no good seaman in Bristol then?
Oh, well, doctor, I shall tell you.
I met this fellow on the dock.
Ahem.
Old navy man.
Fought the French under Admiral Hawke, lost a leg in action.
Kind of man who makes England feared at sea.
Well, he found me a company of the toughest old salts imaginable.
I declare, we could fight a frigate with them.
Ha, ha.
I'm glad to hear it.
What is the man's name?
Uh, John Silver.
They call him Long John Silver.
He's even volunteered to come aboard the ship's cook.
Remarkably civil of him.
Indeed.
What a youthful man.
You know, while I think of it, young Jim, you cut ashore in the gig... ...and give my compliments to Mr. Silver and tell him civil-like, mind you... ...to be aboard by the evening gun.
We sail tomorrow with the tide.
Yes, sir.
Oh, you'll find him... ...at the side of the Spyglass.
Tall fellow, one leg.
Can't miss him.
I'm begging your pardon, sir.
Could you tell me where I could find John Silver?
Long John?
He'll be somewhere in the back.
Bug us not.
Mr. Silver, sir.
Such is my name to be sure.
And who might you be, lad?
Jim Hawkins, sir, ship's boy of the Hispaniola.
Squire Trelawney's compliments says you're to come on board tonight... ...if you please.
We sail at dawn.
Jim Hawkins, is it?
Pleased I am to meet you.
Come, lad.
I expect you're hungry.
A person like you is always hungry as sharks.
I remember when I was just a reefer in the king's navy.
We was fighting the Dutch off Batavia at war.
Black Dog.
Stop him, that's Black Dog, that's one of Flint's men.
I don't care two coppers who he is.
He ain't paid his bill.
You are Morgan.
You was drinking with him.
You never clapped eyes on this Black Dog... ...before now, did you?
No, sir.
You never heard of him neither, did you?
No, Barbecue, on my mother's grave.
You never had a mother.
What was he saying to you anyway?
He was saying... Well, we was jawing of keelhauling.
Yeah.
Mighty suitable topic too.
Back to your place for a lubber, Tom.
Come.
Set yourself down.
Out of there.
Black Dog.
Let's see.
Yes, I've seen that swab before.
He used to come in here with a blind man.
I knew that blind man.
His name was Pew.
It were.
He looked like death.
Sheriff Dance ran him down back at Admiral Benbow.
You see here, Hawkins, you're smart.
Smart as paint.
I seen that right off.
This here's a blessed hard thing for an honest man like me.
Here I've got this confounded son of a Dutchman... ...sitting under my roof, drinking my rum.
What will Squire Trelawney think?
Are you pleased with your ship's company then?
Oh, yes, on the whole, I am... ...but I tell you frankly, doctor, I'm disappointed in the captain.
Good afternoon, squire.
I beg your pardon.
May we have a word?
Ahem.
Yes, yes.
Certainly.
May I present my particular friend Dr. Livesey.
Uh, doctor, this is Captain Smollet, late of His Majesty's Royal Navy.
At your service.
How did you do, captain?
Gentlemen, I don't like this cruise.
I don't like the men.
I don't like my first officer.
That's it.
Short and sweet.
And I suppose you don't like your ship either.
The backstays need adjusting I believe.
Backstays indeed.
And what about your employer, huh?
Stay a bit.
Stay a bit.
The captain has either said too much or he has said too little.
Now, why?
I was engaged, sir, on sealed orders to sail this ship... ...where the gentleman bids me.
Very well, duty is duty.
But now I find every man onboard knows more than I do.
Next thing I learn, we're going after treasure from a young crew, mind you.
Now, I'm told you have a map of an island with longitude and latitude... ...and crosses to show where old Flint's treasure is buried.
Well, I never said a word.
No, no, I swear it.
There is one more thing.
Oh, yes, and what's that, pray?
Powder and arms, sir.
Powder and arms.
They're stowing them in the forehold.
Why not put the arms here in the cabin where we can get at them and they can't?
That is the custom aboard ship, I might add.
Look, captain, I will not be told what is the custom aboard my own ship and what isn't.
I've been to sea before, you know.
Captain Smollet, do you fear a mutiny?
No, sir.
I would not sail at all if I did.
Then what are you suggesting?
Doctor, store the arms and powder aft and keep a weather eye out for treachery.
And for God's sake, don't say another word... ...about this treasure business.
Or upon your soul, it'll be life or death on a lee shore.
Silver, where in blazes have you been?
Get below and serve up a hot meal, man.
It'll be a long night.
Aye, captain.
Supper for the hands directly.
Israel.
Hoist up my sea chest.
Where you want them?
Right.
Anderson, what's this restowing of the bloody muskets?
Captain's orders.
All arms and powder to be stored aft.
By thunder, if we do that, we'll miss the morning tide.
Less talking there, Follett.
Get below, Mr. Silver.
I'll not tell you again.
Aye, sir.
You throw... You stow some of them arms... Hey, you, ship boy... ...get below and help the cook.
If you can't find work, I'll find it for you.
There are no favorites.
Aye, aye, sir.
Very well, Mr. Arrow, unmoor ship if you please.
Aye, aye, sir.
All hands on deck!
Weigh anchor!
Topman weigh aloft!
Topman weigh aloft!
Come on, you.
Turn your backs into it.
Come on!
Heave!
Heave!
Heave!
Heave!
Come on.
Anchor aweigh!
It can drive!
It can drive away, sir.
Very well.
Make sail.
All hands big sail!
Aweigh!
Aloft!
Here now!
Hoist up!
Sail!
On you go, lads.
High up there now!
Go on, Lee!
Up you go, lad.
Bringing us in, all hands on deck.
Headsails and courses, Mr. Arrow.
Headsails and courses there.
Think of those.
Keep your helm, Mr.
Hands.
This is used for the masts.
Rattles there, see, right up to the top.
Let fall.
Let fall!
Let fall!
Let fall!
Okay, now, answer me.
Bring these things to Mr. Arrow.
Southwest by south, Mr.
Hands.
Southwest by south.
Hey, you, get over here.
And heave!
Come on.
Heave!
Heave!
Go on.
Lend a hand, lad.
In the helm, she goes.
Heave!
Come on!
Put your backs into it!
Heave!
Come on, you scruffy smelly dogs!
Heave!
Heave!
Heave!
Gangway!
Come on, away now!
Set brails!
Get up there, you.
Come on, now weigh it out there.
That were done man-of-war fashion there, Jim.
Turn that topsail, Daniel.
What is the matter with that topsail there?
Turn the forward topsail!
We have vast passage and a fair wind for the Caribbean with that captain.
He may be in need of that.
Ready?
Ready she goes.
Raise topsail!
Aye, aloft!
Against the bow!
Raise topsails!
Strike the main course!
Man the gallants!
Don't you worry, lad, this breeze is nothing.
Just a little Biscay blow, won't last more than three or four days.
Oh, God.
Please, just let me die.
Oh, happens that Uncle Long John's fixed you a nice plate... ...of soft pork stew that'll make you feel... Ah.
Mr. Arrow.
It's coming on a little early.
This is a right stuff one, huh?
Chills a man clean through to the bone, Silver, all the same.
Would you care for a bit of a draft, sir?
I, uh, keeps a little rum up for it here.
For cooking, don't you know?
This'll warm the cockles of your heart.
That's just between you and me, sir.
Oh, aye.
I'm obliged.
What's the matter with him?
Lad's bonkers.
Aye.
The Hispaniola sailed swiftly out of the stormy northern latitudes.
Nobody was much surprised... ... when one dark night, Mr. Arrow disappeared entirely... ... and was seen no more.
It was presumed he had been drinking again.
The captain put him down in the log as overboard.
And said we were well rid of him.
We've ran down our easting into the trade winds... ... to get the wind of Treasure Island.
I soon got my sea legs under me.
I learned to reef, hand and steer, and became a tolerable seaman.
It was about the last day of our outward voyage... ... when the squire and I had the dogwatch together.
We were running broad for the island with a steady breeze and the quiet sea.
By the merest chance, the lives of all the honest men aboard... ... would soon depend on me alone.
We must keep a sharp look out, Jim.
The captain says we may raise the island at dawn.
If you can be a good lad and go below and ask Mr. Silver... ...if he's got a mug of tea for me, would you?
Oh, and Jim, see if you can find an apple.
I'm fearfully sharp-set.
Aye, aye, sir.
Visitor, eh?
Oh, not I.
Flint was captain.
I were quartermaster along with this timber leg.
Same broadside I lost my leg, old Pew lost both his deadlights.
Off Trinidad, that's where we were.
So it were aboard Flint's old ship Walrus... ...that I've seen amok with their red blood, fit to sink with the gold in her hold.
Faith, Long John, you've done a pair of sailing.
Flint was the flower of the flock, so Israel Hands told me.
Israel should know.
He were Flint's gunner.
Best in the Spanish Main.
You must all be rich as lords.
I put my 900 pounds safe after I sailed along Captain England.
Near 2000, after Flint.
Where is England's men now?
On Davy Jones mostly.
And where's Flint's?
Aboard here most of them and glad to get the work.
But you, you're smart, young Dick.
Smart as paint.
I seen that right off.
I'm 50, mark you.
But when this here voyage is finished, I set up for gentleman in earnest.
You could do that if you're a-mind to.
Dick is square.
Oh, I know Dick was square.
He's no fool, is Dick.
Well, there's my hand on it, Mr. Silver.
What I wanna know is how long we're gonna stand off and on... ...like a blessed bumboat?
I've had enough of Captain Smollet's butt down there.
I wanna get into that cabin, I do.
I want their pickles and wines.
Pickles and wines?
Israel, you got no more brain than a sea turtle.
Now, you hear me.
You'll berth forward, you'll work hard, you'll keep sober... ...and you'll wait until I gives the word, then cry havoc.
Well, all I ask is when, that's what.
Last bloody minute I can manage, that's when.
We'll widdle the treasure aboard... ...the captain'll sail this ship halfway home before we struck.
How many tall ships, think ye, have I seen laid aboard?
And how many brisk lads drying in the sun at execution dock?
All for the same hurry, hurry, hurry.
But what about the captain?
And Squire Trelawney?
What are we to do about them, anyhow?
We'll cut their throats for them.
Besides, there's someone who needs killing.
Israel's right, lad.
Dead men tell no tales.
When I'm in parliament riding in my coach...
...I don't want none of them sea lawyers aft coming home unlooked for... ...like the devil at prayers.
Dick, there's a good lad.
Jump up and fetch me an apple from the barrel there.
I'm a mite sharp-set.
Hang your apples, Long John.
Let's have a go at the rum.
Yeah.
Well, then, won't hurt neither.
Dick, I trust you.
Here's the key to the rum store.
You fill a pannikin and bring it back.
All right.
But hand me an apple all the same.
Land ho!
Land off the port bow.
Come up there, you lubbers.
Look at this.
There's land down there.
Land ho!
Out of the way.
That the island, Barbecue?
Aye, by the powers, so it be.
There she lies, the island.
Treasure Island.
Oh, my God.
Well, there it is.
Doctor... Jim, lad, where have you been?
You missed the landfall.
I brought her right down to it.
Ha, ha.
What do you say to that, doctor?
Capital seamanship, squire, to be sure.
Doctor, please, may I talk to you?
Mr. Anderson.
Trim that down to gallant sail, man.
This is not one of your Dutchman's barges with the sails all ahoo.
Mr. Anderson.
Right, captain.
Let him trim it himself, swab.
Trim that sail or I'll make you wish you had.
Get with it.
Hey, you, lad.
Get up there.
Doctor, hear me.
Yes, what is it, Jim?
I have to talk to you, the squire and the captain.
What?
I've got some terrible news.
Mutiny.
By God, I'll see them hang for it.
It's worse than mutiny, squire.
It's murder.
If they're successful... ...you won't see anything at all because you will be quite dead.
Captain, you were right and I was wrong.
I own myself an ass and I await your orders.
No more an ass than I, sir.
This crew beats me.
It's that Silver, he's a most remarkable man.
He looked remarkably well from a yardarm.
Now, I see three or four points, if I may.
First, we must go on.
If I put the ship about, they'd come down around us.
Secondly, we have time before us.
I would rather come to blows at once... ...but we must bide our time until the moment is right.
And then we'll strike hard.
Jim here could be more use to us than anyone.
The men are used to him.
I've noticed that Silver trusts him.
Jim, you must infiltrate the enemy camp.
I put prodigious faith in you, boy.
You must be our eyes and ears.
I'll do my best.
By the mark, men, sail!
Let go of the anchor!
Let go!
Quarter less five, sir!
Well, I don't know about treasure... ...but I'll stake my wig there's fever there.
Caught between the devil and the deep blue sea as it were, eh, gentleman?
Captain, I think it's... Mr. Anderson... ...those who wish to go ashore on liberty may do so until the evening gun.
Aye, aye, sir.
Silver, you may splash the main brace.
Aye, sir.
I think we should go below, gentlemen.
Certainly, captain.
Lower away the long boat.
Hoist now, the boat tackle.
Ah, Hawkins.
This here island's a sweet spot, to be sure.
It's a pleasant thing to be young, have 10 toes.
Aye, sir.
If you wanna go ashore and do a bit of exploring... ...old Long John will put up a snack for you to take along.
Mr. Redruth, do you know how to use this?
I have been the squire's gamekeeper for 25 years.
I learned how to shoot straight when I was a lad.
Very good.
You guard the companionway there.
Hunter, you take the aft hatchway.
I'm sure we can rely on you and Joyce.
Aye, sir.
That you can.
I'll do my best, sir.
Joyce, you, um... You stay with Redruth.
Look here, captain.
This is all very well, but we're outnumbered three to one.
Silver will go ashore with his men and calm them down.
I expect you'll keep them in check until they find the treasure.
What of the men onboard, sir?
Silver's bound to leave some to watch us.
They could come down on us any moment.
Why, then we hold the cabin, and God defend the right.
Young Jim can tell us...
Hold on.
Where's Jim Hawkins?
Go on.
Okay.
Here.
Here.
Get them muskets in the boat.
All right, all right, all right.
Take that.
All right.
Yeah.
Get that musket stowed.
All right, relax.
Quiet now.
Keep her steady now.
Here, grab it.
Hold it.
Israel, you will stay aboard... ...and keep an eye on them gentlemen in the cabin.
Aye, aye, Barbecue.
Good lad, get your head down.
Get aboard, you lubber.
Cast off forward.
Give way together.
Oar.
Break your back, you lubbers.
Give me some sweat there, you swab.
Stand by the beachhead.
Hey.
Easy, guv.
Jim, wait.
Wait.
Wait, Jim!
No sooner had I stowed away aboard the long boat... ... than I could not wait to get out of it.
Remembering the squire's words, I set off into the hinterlands of the island... ... to spy upon Silver and his men.
Look sharp, Joycie.
You might... Load, Joycie, load.
You bloody philistine.
I'm doing my bloody best, aren't I?
Get it.
There's a lot of men.
Up your ass with your... Out of the way, Joyce.
Move it!
Turn about!
Move out!
I'm terrible sorry, sir.
I seem to have wounded one in the leg.
Nothing to be ashamed of.
You fight in self-defense.
No, sir.
I was aiming for his head.
This musket's was firing low.
Silver, you're old, and you're honest, or has the name for it.
You'll tell me you'll be led away by that kind of a mess of swabs.
Not you.
Well, um... ...shine or hang, that's about the lay of it.
To turn against my duty, I'd soon to lose my hand.
In the name of God, what was that?
That?
I reckon that'd be Allan.
Then rest his soul for a true seaman.
Amen to that.
As for you, Long John, you can go to the devil.
Good God, not Jim.
I pray not.
Damn that traitor, Silver.
Down, duck!
Hunter, come with me.
Captain, I'd like to go ashore in the gig and reconnoiter.
If Jim's still alive, then maybe I can help him.
Uh, Hunter can row me in, that still leaves you four men to hold the ship.
Very well, doctor.
Be sure you're back before sunset.
I will.
Doctor, watch out for that scoundrel Silver.
Yes.
Take him ashore, Hunter.
Aye, aye, captain.
Who are you?
I'm poor Ben Gunn.
I'm marooned on this island... ...and I haven't seen a Christian soul for these three years.
Were you shipwrecked?
No, matey.
Marooned.
Aye, marooned three long year ago.
And I've lived on berries and goats ever since.
My heart is sore for a Christian diet.
You wouldn't happen to have a piece of cheese about you now, would you?
No.
No.
Many's a night, I've dreamed of cheese.
Toasted, mostly.
If ever I can get back aboard my ship, you could have cheese by the stone.
Shall I, matey?
Oh, thank you.
But that's neither here nor there.
For how are we get onboard?
Well, there's my boat, if it comes to that.
I dug it with my own two hands.
It's in the mangrove swamps by the mouth of the river.
We might try that after dark.
What be your name, matey?
Jim.
Jim Hawkins.
Jim Hawkins.
Well, I'm pleased to make your acquaintance.
You wouldn't think to look at me, would you, that I had a pious mother.
Well, I have.
Remarkably pious.
And I'm back on piety now, Jim.
I thought it all out on this lonely island... ...what providence had set me here.
Aye, and Captain Flint.
Flint?
Flint says you?
Aye.
I were on Flint's ship when he buried the treasure.
Him and six along six strong seamen, gone nigh on a week, they were.
And then one fine morning, up went the signal... ...and back comes Flint, all alone and by himself.
Aye, and the six... Aah!
Into a battle, murder and sudden death.
I often asked old Flint where he buried the treasure.
I only wanted my fair share.
Mine.
"Here's a musket," says he and "There's a shovel," says he: "Go ashore, if you like, then find it."
So they did, they left me, well, for three years.
I've been man of the island, light and dark.
But I'm rich.
Rich.
You tell me true now, that ship you came off, that wasn't Flint's ship?
It is not.
Flint's dead.
But I tell you true, there are some of Flint's men aboard and they've mutinied.
Some of Flint's men?
Not one who hadn't had one leg?
You mean Silver?
Aye, that was his name, Long John Silver.
The devil couldn't hold a lit candle to him.
Everyone was afraid of Flint... ...but even Flint was afeard of Long John Silver.
Water.
It's sweet.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes, this will do us quite well, I believe.
Sir?
Come along, Hunter, back to the ship.
No time to dillydally.
And most importantly, there's a good supply of clean water.
It flows from a little spring beneath the house.
It will serve us better than our present situation onboard ship.
We can scarcely get at the water bags.
They're stored forward with the mutineers.
What do you...?
You mean I have to give up my ship?
Squire, with no water in this heat, we won't last three days.
The doctor's quite right, I'm afraid.
Much as I hate to abandon my ship, we stand a better chance... ...from a strategic point of view, on a fortified situation on the island.
Once we've whipped these blaggards, we can retake the ship at our leisure.
All right.
You're the captain.
Easy now, Hunter.
Easy with that gun, Mr. Hunter.
Careful.
I have it.
I have it.
Stow it forward, squire, if you please.
Make it fast, Redruth.
Come along, man, get aboard.
Take the ship, Joyce.
Row easy, men.
They've spotted us.
Get Silver!
Get Silver!
Go on, wake up!
Go get Silver!
Row.
That's the landing there, captain.
Very good, doctor.
My God, the gun.
Run out your gun.
Israel was Flint's gunner, for the love of God.
Row, lads.
Stretch out, sink or swim.
Mustn't mind if we swamp her now.
Primer.
Primer.
Right, squire, pick me off one of those men.
Hands, if possible.
Get out of there.
Well shot.
Good shot, squire.
Yes.
Yes, it was.
Thank you.
Thank you, Redruth.
Thank you.
Here.
Hunter.
Hunter.
Save the guns.
Aye, aye, captain.
Keep your powder dry.
Come on, man.
Coming through.
Get the powder keg.
Breathe out!
Come through with that.
Heave, they're coming out of their boat.
Move back here!
Hunter, come on.
He's down.
I'm all right.
I'm all right.
Hold on, squire, the keg.
Run to the stockade, men.
Come on, come on, everybody.
Come on.
Move yourself, man.
Now, this way.
This way.
Here we go.
Come on, boys.
Run, run.
Come on.
Move along, Joyce.
Come on.
After them, lads.
Come on now, the other side of the hill.
Hold it.
Hold it.
Up.
Up, up.
Sir!
We're coming now.
Start it, Hunter.
Get him down.
Get him down.
George?
Out of the way, George.
Down with them!
Cut them down!
Fire!
Bloody hell.
Come on, sir.
Bite the bullet, man.
They've had their rations for the day, I reckon.
Be I going, doctor?
Tom... ...you're going home, Tom.
I will.
I wish I had another look at him with my musket.
You did very well, Tom.
Very, very well.
Might you be saying a prayer, sir?
The custom, it is, and all.
Hunter, can you say a prayer?
The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.
He maketh me lie down in green pastures.
Forgive me, Tom.
He leadeth me beside still waters.
Wait, man.
He restoreth my soul.
What's to forgive?
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death...
...I will fear no evil... ...for thou art with me.
Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.
Surely, goodness and mercy will follow me all the days of my life... ...and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
Captain Flint's old fort.
Your friends are there.
Most likely, it's the mutineers.
What?
Flying the red ensign?
Silver would be flying the Jolly Roger.
Hey.
Look.
They've begun the fight.
Ha, ha.
No doubt about it.
Blaze away.
You've little enough powder already, my lads.
Have to do better than that, lads.
Now, you just run down there, mind the round shot... ...and tell the squire what I said.
Ben Gunn has been on this island for three years... ...and most of his time was taken up with finding... Well, another matter.
And, Jim, tell the squire that if those pirates stay ashore this night... ...they'll be widows in the morning.
Ha, ha.
And Jim, don't forget the cheese!
Doctor.
Squire.
Hello.
Jim.
Where the devil have you been, boy?
Took you for dead, lad.
They seem to have run out of ammunition.
No, no, no, doctor, their guns are too hot.
More than likely.
Parmesan cheese?
Why, he says he has a fancy for Parmesan cheese?
Yes, sir.
Toasted, actually.
Good heavens.
I think he's mad, sir.
He says he's rich.
Rich?
Ha-ha-ha.
When a man's spent three years on a desert island... ...he can't appear as sane as you and me.
This is all stuff.
The man's a lunatic, a maroon.
Of no use to us whatsoever.
We're outnumbered by the pirates more than three to one, they got the ship.
I think we may count upon two allies there, rum and the climate.
If Silver's camped where I think he has, I'll stake my wig... ...half his men will be on their back with fever within a week.
I wanna drink.
Damn on you, lazy bugger, wake up.
What's the matter with you?
Jesus.
Someone's cut his throat.
Oh, Shut up, Israel.
Damn your eyes.
What's the matter with you, lubbers?
You'd think you'd never seen a man with his throat cut before.
Flag of truce.
Flag of truce.
To your post, men.
Keep on the cover.
Flag of truce.
Flag of truce, eh?
Captain Silver will come onboard and make terms.
Captain Silver?
Don't know him.
It's only me, sir.
These poor lads have chose me captain after you deserted the ship, sir.
Now, all I ask is a parley and safe conduct... ...in and out of this here stockade.
If there's treachery, it'll be on your side, not ours.
That's enough for me, captain.
No, no, Barbecue.
Don't trust them.
Believe that.
I knows a gentleman when I sees one.
You had better sit down.
Ain't you going to let me inside?
I am not.
Well, you'll have to help me up again, that's all.
Ah, there's young Jim.
Top of the morning to you, Jim.
Doctor, my service.
Squire.
If you got something to say then say it and be done with it.
Right, you were, squire.
Duty is duty.
That were a good scheme of yours last night, I don't deny it.
One of you is mighty handy with a knife.
I don't deny neither, some of us were shook.
I was shook myself, but I tell you... ...if I had woke a second sooner, I'd have caught you in the act.
Poor lad was still warm when I found him.
Well, we want that treasure and we'll have it, one way or the other, that's our point.
You just as soon save your lives, I reckon, that's yours.
Now, you have a chart, haven't you?
That as it may be... ...we know what you meant to do, Silver, only now you can't do it.
Well, you needn't be so husky with a man.
Here's the lay of it.
You give us that chart, leave off the shooting of poor seaman... ...the cutting of their throats and we'll give you a choice.
Either you come aboard the Hispaniola, once the treasure is shipped... ...and I'll give you my affy-davy... ...to clap you somewhere safe ashore.
If that don't suit your fancy... ...you can stay here and I'll give my affy-davy as before... ...to speak to the first ship I sight and send them back to pick you up.
Handsomer than that, you couldn't look to find.
Is that all?
Every last word, by thunder.
Refuse that, you've seen the last of me, but musket-balls.
Now, you hear me.
You can't sail the ship and you can't find the treasure.
You're on a lee shore, Silver.
If you come up unarmed, I'll give you my word to clap you all in irons... ...and take you back to a fair trial in England.
Refuse that... My name is Alexander Smollet.
I've flown my sovereigns colors and I'll see you all to Davy Jones.
Give me a hand up.
Not I.
Who will give me a hand up?
Christ.
Bloody... Before this hour is out... ...you mark my words, Captain Smollet...
...I'll stove in this blockhouse like a rum puncheon.
Them that dies will be the lucky ones.
And... Heave.
And... Heave.
And... Heave.
And... Heave.
And... Heave.
And... Come on, you swabs, break your backs.
Pull.
Heave.
Heave.
And... Heave.
Now, men, I've given Silver a broadside.
Pitched it in red-hot on purpose.
And I expect we'll be attacked directly.
I have no doubt we can drub him if you fight with discipline.
Now, we've a swivel gun and a score of muskets.
Jim, you low to the table and power the cutlasses there.
Doctor, take the door, but stand well back.
Yes, captain.
Hunter man a swivel gun.
Joyce, take the south wall.
Mr. Trelawney...
If you please, sir.
If I see anyone, am I to fire?
As I told you.
Very good, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Right.
Squire...
Yes, I will take the west side.
Quite so.
Everyone have a cutlass handy.
If they board us, it'll come to hand... Mr. Joyce.
Bloody hell.
They brought up a gun.
Damn the blighters.
Heave.
Heave and heave.
Anyone hurt?
No.
All right.
Scoundrels!
Did you hit your man?
I think not, sir.
I'm afraid I missed the blighter.
I'm sorry, it won't happen again.
Better to tell the truth.
Hawkins, load.
Give it to them.
Musket.
Thanks, lad.
Fire!
Hold it, mate.
Fire!
Master Hawkins, are you all right?
Yes, sir.
Good, lad.
Take this, you damn swabs.
All right, lads, ready to board.
Get out there.
Come on, you swabs.
This loaded?
They're loaded?
Yes, sir.
Attack!
The swivel gun.
Jim, behind you.
Well, don't stop.
Keep loading.
From the sea!
Out, lads, fight them in the open.
Come on.
Come on.
I'll take him, doctor.
Get him.
Quite unnecessary, Joyce.
Save your ammunition, man.
I'll try to.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Hunter, we must silence that gun.
Aye, aye, sir.
Get the powder keg.
Right, sir.
Fuse, man.
Hurry.
Jim!
No!
Ready?
Aye, aye, sir.
Shoot at him.
Kill him.
Kill him, you bloody swab.
Get back here, you bloody yellow dog.
Easy now.
Come on.
Get him inside.
Come on.
Get him inside.
Sit him right down.
There you go.
Have some, here.
Now, you lie quietly, captain.
You have an ugly splinter wound.
And if you keep still and do not freight about, then you will live.
Aye, aye, doctor.
And you, watch your step.
Doctor, may I come with you?
I'm afraid not, Jim.
You had quite enough adventure for one day.
I'll be back before sun up.
Good luck to you, doctor.
Thank you, squire.
Where in the name of Davy Jones be he going?
Why, to find Ben Gunn.
I wish I were going with him.
My, God.
That's the first ship I ever lost.
Blast these bloody buccaneers to hell.
So it was that I took French leave of my comrades.
I was a fool, if you like, but I was only a boy... ... and I had a scheme in my head and was determined to do it.
I would go down to the mouth of the river... ... and find the boat Ben Gunn said he had hidden in the mangroves.
There were only two lights visible in the darkness.
The great fire on shore... ... and the pinpoints of light coming from the anchored ship.
It was then that the rest of the scheme took shape in my mind.
And I set out to retake the Hispaniola.
Oh, come on.
He's there.
Come on.
Give it.
What do you mean?
Shut up, you bloody swab bastard.
It's mine.
Trying to cheat me out of my treasure as well as my rum.
Well, I owned that and it belongs to me.
Damn you!
Come aboard, Mr.
Hands.
Rum.
Oh.
By thunder, I wanted some of that.
Much hurt, are we?
Where might you have come from, eh, laddie?
I've come aboard to take possession of the ship, Mr.
Hands.
You'll please regard me as your captain.
Now, look here.
You give me food and drink... ...an old handkerchief to tie my leg up with... ...and I'll tell you how to get some sail on her... ...and lay a course back to the island.
I'm not going back to the anchorage.
I mean to take her to the North Inlet and beach her there.
To be sure you do.
I'm not such an infernal lubber after all.
And now you ask the wind of me.
North Inlet, it is.
Heave away the halyard!
Stand by the forecourse.
Turn your sails.
Heave away on it.
I'll take the wheel now, Mr.
Hands.
Aye, there's Foremast Hill.
North Inlet's just beyond.
Take your orders from me, Captain Hawkins... ...and we'll beach this hulk and be done with it.
Take her up going into the wind.
There's a good place to beach your ship in, Hawkins.
North of Cat's Paw.
Stand by the luffer.
Starboard a little.
Larboard a little.
Steady.
Steady as she goes.
Now, my Hawkins... ...take her into the wind.
Oh, Jim.
You didn't keep your powder dry, hey?
Didn't they learn you nothing?
One more step, Mr.
Hands, and I'll blow your brains out.
Jim, shipmate.
I reckon we're fouled, eh?
You and me, we'll have to sign articles.
I never have no luck, not I.
And I guess I'll have to strike my colors with you... ...which comes hard for a master mariner to a ship's younker like you.
Pieces of eight!
Hey.
Come on, who's there?
Light that torch, Bill.
Why, it's Jim Hawkins.
Shiver me timbers.
Dropped in, like, eh?
I take that friendly.
Well, Jim, here you are.
Quite a pleasant surprise for old John.
I'll give you the truth of it.
I always wanted you to join with us... ...and take your share and die a gentleman... ...and now, my lad, you've got to.
Oh?
See here, you can't go back to your own lot, they won't have you.
Ungrateful scamp, the captain calls you.
Right.
So without, you start a whole ship's company by yourself... ...which might be lonely, you'll have to join with Captain Silver.
Well, he ain't getting my share.
Am I to answer, then?
No one's a-pressing of you, lad.
Take your bearings.
Well, if I'm to choose...
...I say I have a right to know what's what.
He'd be the lucky one as knowed that.
You'll perhaps batten down your hatches till you're spoke to.
Yesterday morning... ...Mr. Hawkins, in the dogwatch, down come Dr. Livesey with a flag of truce.
"Captain Silver," he says, "you're sold out.
Ship's gone."
Well, we looked out, and by thunder, he was right.
The old ship was gone.
"Well," says the doctor, "now let's bargain."
So he did.
Here we are, blockhouse, stores, rum, whole blessed boat.
As for them, they tramped away out of here, which I don't know where.
Is that all?
It's all you're to know for now, my son.
Very well.
You're in a bad way.
Ship lost, treasure lost, your whole business gone to wreck.
And if you wanna know who did it... ...it was I.
You?
Yeah.
I was in the apple barrel the night we sighted land.
I heard you and Dick and Israel Hands who is now at the bottom of the sea.
As for the ship...
...I cut her cable and brought her to a place where you'll never see her... ...not one of you.
What?
Silence fore and aft.
Is that your answer, lad?
Kill me if you like.
But one thing, if you spare me, bygones are bygones... ...and when you're all in court for piracy and murder...
...I'll save you all I can.
Kill another if you like or keep a witness to save you from the gallows.
Yeah, good.
It was him that knowed Black Dog.
It was him who lifted the chart from Billy Bones.
First to last, I reckon, we've split upon you, Jim Hawkins.
Go on, skin him from the neck.
Kill him.
Give him the Spanish torture.
Well, lad, here goes.
Who be you, George Merry?
Maybe you thought you was captain here, perhaps.
By the powers, I'll teach you better.
I'm captain here by election.
Captain because I'm the best man by a long sea mile.
I like that boy.
I never seen a better boy than that.
He's more a man than any pair of you bilge rats a-boarded here.
Let me see the man who'll lay a hand on him.
Draw a cutlass, him that dares.
I'll show you the color of his insides.
Hmm.
Asking your pardon, captain.
You're pretty free with some of the rules.
Perhaps you'll kindly keep an eye on the rest.
This crew's dissatisfied.
This crew has rights like other crews.
We claims our rights and steps outside for council.
Fo'c'sle council.
According to rules.
See you, Jim.
You're within half a plank of death, or worse.
And they're going to throw me off.
But I'll stand by you, thick or thin.
"You stand by Hawkins," I says to myself, "he'll stand by you."
You mean all's lost?
That's about it.
I'll save your life if I can... ...but, Jim, if we gets off this here lee shore... ...you save old John from swinging, huh?
I'll do what I may.
Ah, that's good enough for me.
Oh, here comes a squall, or I'm mistook.
Let them come, lad, I've still got a shot in me locker.
Well, hand it over, lubber.
Step up, Dick, I won't eat you.
The black spot, I thought so.
Where might you have got the paper?
Oh, hello, this ain't lucky.
You've gone and cut this out of a Bible.
What fools cut a Bible?
There.
What'd I say?
"No good'll come to that," I said.
Well, you've about fixed it now.
What soft-headed lubber had a Bible?
Well, Dick.
Then Dick can get to prayers.
He's had his slice of luck as Dick.
It weren't my idea.
Now, look here, Silver.
This crew's tipped you the black spot.
Turn it over, read what's wrote there.
Thank you, George.
You always was brisk for business... ...and knowed the rules by heart.
Aye.
"Deposed."
Very pretty wrote to be sure.
Your hand of write, George?
You'll be captain next, I shouldn't wonder.
You're done, Long John.
You made a hash of this cruise.
You let the enemy out of this trap here for nothing?
Why?
I don't know.
Which you wouldn't let us go at them on the march, neither.
Which made good sea sense to me.
And there's this here boy.
Now, you just step down here and help vote.
Is that all?
Enough too.
We'll all swing and sun-dry for your bungling.
And you're near the mark there by Christ.
Looks like a hornpipe in a rope's end at Execution Dock.
But my bungling?
For you that done it.
You, George, and you, Tom Morgan... ...you infernal gang of grass-combing lubbers.
Not me.
If I'd had my way, we'd be sitting aboard the Hispaniola right now... ...eating a plum duff with our hold full of treasure.
And you have that Davy Jones' insolence to stand up for captain over me... ...George Merry, you miserable son of a whore.
The map.
It's Flint's map.
That's Flint right enough.
J.F.
A score below with a clove hitch to it, so he done ever.
Where?
Mighty pretty.
But how are we going to get away with it?
Us and no ship.
I give you warning, George, one more word of your sauce... ...and I'll eat your liver for breakfast.
Now I resign, by thunder.
I'll let who you want for captain.
I'm done with it.
No, John, you're captain here.
Barbecue for captain.
Barbecue for captain.
Well, George, looks like you'll have to wait another turn.
This, uh, black spot, it ain't good for much now, is it?
Dick's crossed his luck and spoiled his Bible, that's about all.
Here, Jim.
Here's a curiosity for you.
It's from Revelation.
"Without are dogs and murderers."
Amen to that.
Blockhouse, ahoy!
It's the doctor.
Hello, doctor.
Top of the morning.
We've got quite a surprise for you, sir.
A new boarder and lodger.
Fit as a fiddle and slept like a supercargo alongside of old John.
Doctor.
Jim, what on...?
Aye, Jim as ever was.
Here's your patients.
All ready, doctor.
Well, well, duty first.
Let's overhaul these patients of yours.
Well, George Merry, how goes it?
You're a pretty color, certainly.
Did you take your bolus?
Has he taken his medicine, men?
Aye, aye, sir.
Aye, like a soldier.
Good.
Here's another draft.
Go on.
Next.
Dick don't feel well, sir.
I feel fine.
Oh, step up here, lad.
Let's see your tongue.
No.
Tongue.
Clear.
Your tongue is fit to frighten the French.
Another fever, Mr. Silver.
Shocking.
There.
There.
That come to spoiling Bibles.
It wasn't my idea.
That's what come to being arrant asses, not knowing honest air from poison.
Camping in a swamp.
You've got malaria, Dick.
Take this medicine.
Oh, come on, lad, take it.
That's it.
Off you go.
Well, that's done for the day, I believe.
You see, Jim, as I'm a mutineer's doctor, as a part of the bargain...
...I make it a point not to lose a man for King George's gallows.
And now, I'd wish to have a talk with this boy, please.
No, no, my God.
Oh, shut up, George.
Hawkins, give your word of honor as a young gentleman not to slip your cable?
Oh, just a darmy minute.
Aye.
Aye, sir.
All right, doctor, you just step outside the palisade.
I'll bring the boy down.
You can yarn through the spars.
Silver, you're playing... No, by thunder!
You bloody damn fools.
You think we're going to break the treaty the very day we go hunting treasure?
Break it when the time comes.
Right.
Come along, Jim.
Easy, lad.
They can round on us in an instant.
Doctor.
Boy'll tell you how I saved his life and were deposed for it too.
Steering mighty close to the wind with these cutthroats.
You won't think it amiss, mayhap, to speak a good word for me when the time comes.
Why, John, you're not afraid.
Doctor, you know I'm no coward... ...but I'll confess I have the shakes upon me for the gallows.
That's a long stretch, is that.
And I'll step aside now.
So, Jim, here you are.
As you have brewed, so shall you drink, my boy.
When Captain Smollet was well, you dared not have ran off.
When he was wounded, by George, it was downright cowardly.
Doctor, you might spare me.
I've blamed myself enough.
I'm as good as dead anyway.
I'd be dead by now if it weren't for Silver.
I'm not afraid to die.
And I guess I deserve it.
But if they should come to torture me...
Torture?
Jim, Jim, we can't have this.
Whip over and we'll run for it.
Doctor, I passed my word.
Yes, I know, I know.
But I gave my word.
Yes, so you did, Jim.
But never mind all that.
I'll take it on my own shoulders.
Now, jump.
One jump and you're out.
We'll run like antelopes.
Hmm?
No.
You wouldn't do it yourself.
Very well.
You're a brave lad.
But why should they want to talk to you?
Because they know I know where the ship is.
The ship?
Yeah.
The Hispaniola.
I cut her cable, part by luck, part by risking.
I got her beached in the North Inlet, safe and sound.
The ship.
Jim, well done.
At every step, it's you that saves our lives.
You don't imagine we're going to let you lose yours.
Silver.
Let me give you some advice.
I shouldn't be in too much hurry to find that treasure.
I'll do what's possible, which that ain't.
Doctor, I can only save my life and the boy's by seeking that treasure.
You may lay to that.
Very well.
But look for squalls when you find it.
Now, you said either too much or too little.
Too much by far.
Now, you keep that boy close beside you.
If you need any help, halloo.
Good day to you, Mr. Silver.
Bye, Jim.
Goodbye.
God keep you.
Come along, lad.
We're going on a treasure hunt.
Aah!
Just you keep close alongside of old Long John.
I've seen the doctor signal you to run and I've seen you say no.
That's one to you, Jim.
South southeast, for Spy-glass Hill.
Mateys.
Silver.
He can't have found the treasure.
No, he didn't do that.
This here's only Spy-glass Hill.
What sort of way is that for bones to lie?
It ain't in nature.
I have a notion.
Spy-glass Hill, tall tree, the point north and north northeast.
Here, Jim, just you take a bearing there along the line of them bones.
North northeast.
They point north.
I thought so.
This here's a pointer.
By thunder, that Flint were a cold bastard.
Him and six was alone here.
He killed them, every man.
And this one he hauled here and laid out with a compass for a bearing.
Shiver my timbers.
Six they were and six are we.
Great guns, if Flint were living now, this'll be a hot spot for you and me.
Clear there, stow this talk.
Flint's dead.
Fetch a course for the doubloons.
The point north to north northeast.
Come on, lad.
George, rig a line, aloft with you.
There you go, lad.
Get into that line now.
All right, lad.
Clamp on to that part.
Jim, I can manage.
I told you, you can make it with me.
Off you go.
Good lad.
Heave away.
I don't feel sharp.
Thinking of Flint, it were, has done me.
Thinking at all has done you, Tom Morgan.
You can praise your stars Flint's dead.
He died bad, Flint did.
He was an ugly devil too.
Blue in the face.
That's how the rum took him.
Right, he did.
And all around him.
Fifteen men on a dead man's chest Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum It's Flint, by thunder.
Flint as ever it was.
Holy spirit... Now, hold fast now.
That might've come about that someone's larking about.
Someone that's flesh and blood too, you may lay to that.
But you know, that sounded mighty like Flint to me.
Darby McGraw.
Darby McGraw.
Fetch aft the rum, Darby.
Darby McGraw.
They were his last words.
His last words on this Earth.
But one man of his crew alive, what went to sea with 75.
That fixes it.
Let's go.
Hold on now.
There's nobody on this island ever heard of Darby, none but us.
Also the devil.
You hear me.
I come to get that treasure.
I was never afeard of Flint in life, and by the powers, I ain't afeard of him dead.
There's 700,000 pounds not a quarter mile from here.
It's child's play to find it.
Seven hundred thousand gold and silver.
And jewels too, I recollect.
Aye.
Jewels by the bushel baskets.
And silver bars.
Aye.
Think on it, lads.
Seven hundred thousand pounds.
Belay there, John.
Don't you go a-crossing the spirit.
Spirit, eh?
Well, maybe.
But man or beast or spirit, I don't care if it's Beelzebub himself...
...I'm going to get that loot.
Aye, that's about the right bearing.
No time, my mates.
All together!
It's gone.
What?
Someone must've been here before us.
Son of a dog.
Seven hundred thousand pounds, by thunder, gone to the devil.
No.
Here, Jim, standby for trouble.
Two guineas.
Is that it?
By God.
Two guineas.
That's your 700,000 pounds, is it?
Keep digging, boys.
You'll find some pignuts, I shouldn't wonder.
Pignuts?
Damn your lies.
Look at him.
He knew it all along.
Take a look at his face, mates.
You'll see it right there.
Standing for captain again, George?
Silver.
It's the doctor!
Run.
Now, George, I reckon I settled you.
Jim, are you all right?
Fair enough, doctor.
Thank you, doctor.
You come in just about the nick, I'd say.
Ben Gunn.
Well, here you are.
Aye, I am Ben Gunn.
I am.
And how do, Mr. Silver?
Pretty well, thank you, says you.
Darby McGraw.
Darby McGraw.
Ha, ha.
It was Ben that found the treasure.
By God, how in blazes did he do that without the map?
I found the skeleton, same as you... ...and I dug up the treasure and carried it all on my back.
Many weary journeys it were too.
And I stored it all safely in my cave.
Ben.
Ben, to think it was you that done me.
No wonder you was so quick to give us that map, doctor.
It weren't good for nothing.
Jim?
Jim.
Jim, thank God, you're still alive.
You too, squire.
Good day to you, squire.
It was life or death on a lee shore for Jim and me.
Back to back, we were.
Long John Silver, you're a prodigious villain and a liar, sir.
A monstrous impostor, sir.
The doctor here says I'm not to prosecute you and I'll keep that side of the agreement.
But the dead men hang about your neck like millstones, sir.
Thank you kindly, squire.
I dare you to thank me!
Jim.
Well, Jim.
Silver, I see you've managed to save your own neck once again.
Aye, aye, captain.
Come back to do me duties, sir.
Ah, yes.
You're a man to keep your word.
We all know that.
Stand aside, sir.
Jim, come with me.
I have something to show you.
Here, look.
Oh, my.
Jim... ...Flint's blood money.
Well, squire.
Doctor.
I was kept busy all day in the cave, packing the minted money into bags.
There was nearly every variety of money in the world: English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese and Arabian coins... ... Georges and louis... ... gold doubloons and double guineas and moidores... ... and sequins and silver pieces of eight.
All the treasure Flint had amassed in a lifetime of blood and murder.
All the way, sir.
You cack-handed old fool, what are you doing?
I've been ashore too long, sir.
Squire.
Thank you, Silver.
Squire.
Come on, come on, come on.
Put your back into it up front.
From the pirates who had fled into the hinterlands, we heard no more.
We rowed out a great kedge anchor on a hawsehole... ... and at the crest of the flood tide, winched the Hispaniola off the sandbar... ... and set sail at last for home.
Headsails and courses, Mr. Hunter.
Jim?
Let go clew lines and foot lines.
Haul away!
Can't say I'm sorry to see the last of that island be gone.
I hope I never see it again.
A power of good men died aboard there.
And what's to become of old Long John?
Well, I expect you'll stand for trial.
I will testify on your part, as I promised.
Aye, Jim, your word's good, I knows that.
But them lawyers, they got ways... ...of twisting a man's words, bending them back on him... ...till he's fouled by his own haws, as it were.
I have a mortal fear of hanging.
You know that, Jim.
You never seen a man hanged aboard ship, did you?
Ran up to the end of the yardarm by his own mess mates.
Black hood over his face, kicking and screaming, strangling slow.
Can take hours to die.
Not a pretty sight at all.
I wouldn't think so.
But maybe you should've thought of that before you turned to piracy.
I won't be fooled by you again, Long John.
You saved my life and I'll try and save yours.
Meanwhile, maybe you better get below.
The captain will be piping supper soon.
He'll have your other leg off, if it's not ready.
You bucko.
What a pair we two could've made.
Evening, Ben Gunn.
Evening, Barbecue.
Wouldn't it be a mortal shame if you was to cry out now?
I might just let this here knife slip and cut your throat to the neck bone.
It's mighty sharp.
Right.
Right.
Now, you just stay the course there and give your old shipmate time to get away... ...and I'll forget all about how you done me back there at the island.
Aye, aye, captain.
You give me a good half hour to get up to windward, mind you.
I will.
And the best of luck to you, Silver.
Silver's gone.
What do you mean, gone?
For God's sake, man, will you ever learn to knock?
He's taken a sack of doubloons... ...and one of the gold bars.
What?
Blast and damn.
Ben Gunn, what's the matter with you?
Didn't you see anything?
He must've gone right past you, you waif-faced imbecile... Oh, no, sir.
I didn't see nothing, sir.
Just watching my course, like a good seaman, sir.
I was.
Can't you overhaul him, captain?
Oh, surely, you can sail the Hispaniola faster than a little boat like that.
Not to windward.
He has the weather gauged of us, man.
We could tack about all night and never catch him.
Of Silver, we heard no more.
That formidable, seafaring man with one leg... ... has gone clean out of my life.
Perhaps he has found comfort somewhere along the Spanish Main... ... plying his old trade.
As for Treasure Island, the bar silver lies there still... ... but wild horses couldn't drive me back to that accursed place.
In my worst nightmares, I still hear the surf booming along its coast.
I sit up right in bed, with the sharp voice of Captain Flint ringing in my ears.
Happy birthday, Mrs. Hawkins.
Yes, Mrs. Hawkins.
Younger every year.
None of your frippery, John Harrow.
But music and friends do make you feel... Where's Jim?
He's in the kitchen, I think.
Just put a head on that one, John.
It's going to thunder and lightning.
Then you best go lock yourself up in a closet.
You made that cake?
No, I didn't.
And I'll thank you not to say I did.
Jim Hawkins made a cake!
Jim Hawkins made a cake!
No, I didn't.
Only girls make cakes.
My mother made this cake herself.
Surely she had to have a cake for her birthday.
Jim Hawkins dropped a cake!
Jim Hawkins dropped a cake!
Jim Hawkins dropped a cake!
Stop following me around.
Upon my soul!
Why, Jim, you didn't go and bake a...?
Here's the cake you made, Mother.
I trust it's good.
It's the best cake ever.
I raise a mug to Jim Hawkins, proprietor of the Admiral Benbow.
Jim.
Speech!
Come on, get up.
Speech, speech.
Well, I don't know what to say, but ever since Father died... ...and with Mother having to do the work, I'm truly glad each time she gets older.
I mean, then I get older too.
And soon I'll be able to do all the work and won't have to make speeches.
Here she comes.
Everybody to the taproom.
We'll cut the cake in there.
Everybody take a seat.
Oh, Jim, there go the shutters.
Go up and close them, will you?
At your service, ma'am.
Now what?
I'm scared.
Aren't you scared?
No, I'm not.
It's girls that make me nervous.
Why don't you go downstairs, where there's more room to be scared in.
I want a bunk with a sea view.
This way, sir.
Have you seen this man around here before?
He looks like a seafaring man.
He certainly doesn't belong to these parts.
Hey!
I want a noggin of rum.
Yes, sir.
Mind, you clod.
Have an eye to that chest.
Here.
Now, you never made this voyage, you understand?
You never seen me and you don't know nothing.
Get out.
What are you looking for?
Strangers, sonny, strangers.
I don't like strangers coming aboard me suddenly.
Makes my spine jump like a porpoise, it does.
What might your name be?
Jim Hawkins.
Now, look here, Jim, you and me's going to be mates.
You'll get a silver four-penny bit every month... ...if you watches out for strangers and comes and lets the old captain know... ...when they tops the horizon.
Well, what manner of strangers?
Seafaring men.
Well, all seafaring men?
No, no, no, son.
There's a special cut of the jib to these seafaring men.
But most especially, I want you to keep your eye open... ...for a seafaring man with one leg.
A seafaring man with one leg?
Aye.
Upon my word, sir, what shall I tell them?
What do they want?
Never you mind what they want.
You go on down below and get me a noggin of rum.
A double noggin, Jim, because I'm becalmed.
Becalmed on a sea of troubles, and I've got to fill my sails again.
Yes, sir.
Who is he, Jim?
What did he say?
I don't know.
Something about seafaring men with no ears and no legs and no... Hey, drop anchor, matey.
We'll fill the cask where you lie.
Rum for all hands, say I.
Here's a new port all full of pretty wenches... ...and strong young buckoes.
Clear the decks for pleasant action.
Fill a pretty belly with grog and that's what makes the world... ...spin on its poles, say I.
Hey, belay there.
The rum.
I'm not much on strong liquor, sir.
Besides, we have to go now.
It's getting... "Go," say ye?
You'll stay.
You'll all stay.
Sit yourselves down on your binnacles.
Jim, matey, the rum.
I ain't like all seafaring men.
Genteel, I am, and a dove at heart, mates.
Why, I know some seafaring men, them as boarded a Spanish brig... ...all loaded down with Castilian dons and their beauteous ladies.
And what did they do?
Genteel like me, ye thinks?
No.
They slices them dons like bread loaves... ...and feeds them to the sharks.
And what did they do to the beauteous ladies?
Why, after courting their favor, as it were... ...saving your presence, matey... ...they slits the veins of their pearly white arms... ...and uses their blue blood to warm their rum.
And then what did they do, matey?
Bless my soul, sir, what else was left?
There was the song, Jim.
Singing by all hands.
Now, come on.
We'll all tip the stave.
Come on!
Come on, sing!
Bottle of rum, you old hag!
Bottle of rum!
"Bottle of rum!"
We'll tip it again now.
Come on!
Dr. Livesey.
Mrs. Hawkins.
It was Mother's birthday.
We were just having a little entertainment, doctor.
Well, my compliments, Mrs. Hawkins.
A little brandy, Jim.
My pleasure, sir.
Come on, mates.
Now we'll tip it again.
Thought sure we were in for a storm, but... Hey!
Silence there between decks.
You addressing me, sir?
Is it blowing a gale of wind you can't hear me?
What did I say?
I have only this to say: I don't know you.
But by your look, if you continue drinking rum... ...the world will soon be rid of a very dirty scoundrel.
I'll split you double, you...
If you do not lower that cutlass...
...I promise on my honor that you shall hang at the next assizes.
And furthermore, sir...
...I'm not only a doctor, I'm magistrate here.
And if I catch another breath of complaint against you... ...if only for a piece of incivility like this, I'll have you routed out of here.
Let that suffice?
I ask your patience, sir.
Just a squall from a poor old sailor man... ...who took too much rum over his bowsprit.
I ask your pardon.
It was a nice party.
Don't worry, Mrs. Hawkins.
Don't worry.
Goodbye.
Thank you.
Praise be, Jim, the man was only full of talk.
But bless my soul, sir.
He certainly can sing.
Well, sonny.
Come here.
Come here, sonny.
A little closer.
Here.
Now, is this here table for my mate Bill?
I don't know your mate Bill.
But don't Bill live here?
No.
Nobody but the captain.
Oh, captain, it is?
Truly, sir.
I can...
Here comes my old mate Bill now.
Bless his heart, to be sure.
Jim, lad!
The rum.
I'm becalmed again.
Come, Bill.
You know me.
You know an old shipmate, surely.
Black Dog.
Black Dog as ever was.
Come for to see his old shipmate Billy.
Well, speak up.
The porter, sonny.
Porter.
Well?
Now, Bill, I've been after you, now.
No, by the powers, and there's an end to it!
If it comes to swinging, swing one, swing all.
I'll part your dirty wig!
Out, you blubberous barnacle.
Next time I'll sever your gullet.
Humor him, Jim.
I'll be back.
Where you going?
To Mr. Doolittle's.
I'll get him to ride to Livesey's... ...so he and his constables can come and get that man out of here at once.
Rum, Jim.
Rum.
Are you hurt?
I gotta get away from here, Jim.
I gotta slip my hawsers.
Captain, you've been drinking too much.
Remember, the doctor said... Doctors is all swabs.
I've lived on rum, I tell you.
It's been meat and drink to me, man and wife.
And I needs rum now, Jim.
Mother locked up all the rum.
She said...
I've got to have it, Jim.
I gotta have it.
Look.
See how me fingers fidget?
I can't stop it, Jim.
I gotta have a drain of rum.
If I don't, I'll have the horrors.
And then I'll see Flint there behind you in the corner, just as plain as print.
Well, is Flint the one-legged man?
No, no, but he'll be there too.
Both of them will be there if you don't get me the rum.
Oh, go on, quick.
Before they come in and slips me the black spot.
Well, what's the black spot?
It's a summons, Jim.
A summons.
Do they wanna kill you?
No, no, it's my sea chest they're after.
What's in the sea chest?
Pieces of eight.
Pearls as big as ostrich eggs.
All the gold your heart can desire.
And just for a little noggin of rum, Jim.
Would a half a noggin do?
That's my matey.
There we go, lad.
Wait here.
I'll see.
Will any kind friend inform a poor blind man... ...who has lost the precious sight of his eyes in the gracious defense... ...of his native country, England, and God bless King George... ...where in whatever part of this country he may now be.
You are at the Admiral Benbow, Black Hill Cove, sir.
I hear a voice.
A young voice.
Will ye not take my hand, me kind young friend, and lead me in?
Certainly, sir.
I...
I... Now, boy, take me to the captain.
Well, no, sir.
Upon my word, I dare not.
Take me in straight or I'll break your arm.
Oh, it isn't for yourself, I mean.
He has his cutlass.
Another gentleman... Come, now, march.
Yes, sir.
Hi, Bill.
Your old friend Pew.
Now, sit where you are, Bill.
Gentlemanly-like.
I can't see, but I can hear even a finger stirring.
Business is business.
Now, right up to him.
Aye, Bill.
Now, boy, take his hand and bring it close to mine.
There.
That's done.
That's done.
We'll do him yet!
Not a doubloon.
I fought and bled for it.
It's mine.
Every farthing of it.
Mine!
I'm swing on Execution Dock... Jim, what's happened?
Why, he's dead.
"You have till 10 tonight."
Black spot.
And they'll be back again too.
Who will be?
The men that wanted to kill the captain.
They wanna own the treasure in his chest upstairs.
Let's get out of here.
No.
The captain owes us money.
We'll go get what he owes us.
They can't take that.
Jim, I'm so frightened.
I'll see no harm comes to you, Mother.
I'm not afraid.
We shouldn't, Jim, they'll... Come on, Mother.
He says there's gold and silver and pearls as big as ostrich eggs.
We'll show them we're honest.
We'll take what is our due and not a farthing over.
Why, there's nothing there at all.
There's some coins, though.
Open the door!
There's something.
I'll take what I have.
Up.
Down with it!
In!
In!
In!
Bill's dead.
Well, search him... ...some of you brass-brained lubbers.
Get the chest!
Aye, aye, sir.
Jim, I'm going to faint.
No, Mother.
Here.
Down with the door!
They've been here before.
Someone's turned out the chest alow and aloft.
Is it there?
There's some money.
Not money, you squid.
Flint's fist.
Flint's fist!
You below!
Is it down there?
It's that whining little sneaking brat.
I should have torn his arm off.
I should have put his eyes out!
Scatter and find him!
We'll have to budge, mates.
What?
Give him the whip.
Wait.
Johnny.
Black Dog.
Wallace.
You wouldn't leave old Pew, would you, mates?
After them, boys.
Scour the thickets.
Jim!
Jim!
Mrs. Hawkins!
Here we are, Dr. Livesey.
Here we are.
Oh, dearie me, dearie me.
Who were they?
They wanted to kill the captain.
But he dropped dead... ...just like you said he would.
Well, what did they say?
Well, they wanted something up in his chest upstairs.
Flint's fist or something, I don't know.
This is all I took.
Do you suppose that could be anything?
Flint's fist?
Well, there's only one Flint.
I know that.
Why, it's only a map.
What are those funny red crosses there?
"Bulk of treasure."
Bless my... Quickly.
Into the coach, both of you.
Vance, back here at once.
Well, where are we going, doctor?
To Squire Trelawney's.
Jim, my boy, you may have stumbled... ...on the secret of the century.
It's it.
It's it, I tell you.
Squire Trelawney, are you sure?
Sure?
The actual chart of Flint's treasure.
The very island it's buried on.
Latitude.
Longitude.
Jim, now, look here.
The very blockhouse and stockade... ...where the infamous pirate held off attack.
Squire, you get so confoundedly overheated.
What do you propose to do?
Why, bless me for a fat mole, we'll... We'll dig it up.
Won't we, Jim?
Won't we, young Hawkins?
I have my own shovel, sir.
Shovel?
Shovel?
You'll have more than that.
You'll be the richest lad in England.
In the whole world.
But, squire, a moment, now.
We'll need a ship.
We'll need a crew.
Tomorrow I leave for Bristol.
In two weeks from today, I'll have the finest ship... ...and the choicest crew in England.
Those cutthroats who attacked tonight have shown us that they'll stop at nothing.
Others too, perhaps.
We must proceed with absolute secrecy.
Exactly, sir.
Exactly.
Sphinxes, all.
Do you hear that, Jim?
Sphinxes.
Sphinxes, all.
There's just one man I'm afraid of.
And who's that, sir?
Who's that?
Name the dog.
You, sir.
For you cannot hold your tongue.
I?
I?
Why, doctor, blast me, I... Livesey, you're always in the right of it.
I'll be as silent as a grave.
Tallyho, Jim.
How are you, my boy?
It was a wondrous ride, sir.
Where's our ship?
We all ready to sail?
Not for several days.
Dr. Livesey won't be here till Saturday.
Hunter.
Where's our ship, sir?
Ship?
Ship?
There she lies.
The good ship 'Hispaniola'.
And a tighter craft never sailed the seven seas.
Bless my soul, sir.
All right, now, give them another broadside.
All together.
One, two, th... Well, sonny, was you aiming to blow the other leg off?
I don't think it's loaded.
Well, you ought to be certain.
You be the captain of that ship, now, be'n't you?
Well, I... Come on, Jim, I'll show you to your... Oh, he wanted to know if I was captain.
My captain is on his way from Dover.
Is there anything I can do?
No, thank ye, sir.
Just an old sailor hobbled down... ...to get a smell of the salt air and cast these eyes on a trim craft... ...the likes of which you sure have got here.
Yes, I think I have a good eye for a ship.
Do you mind if I just come aboard, please?
Just for a spell.
Yes, you're... You're welcome, my man.
Of course.
Squire, sir.
This way.
Squire.
This way, my friend.
Any assistance?
Well, well... Silver's the name.
Long John Silver, they calls me.
At your service, sir.
Mr. Silver, sir.
Trelawney's my name.
Squire Trelawney.
And this is our cabin boy, Jim.
Jim Hawkins.
Aye, matey.
Smart as paint, I'll warrant, huh?
Smart enough to see you've only one leg.
Jim, boy.
Yes, sir.
You're pretty smart, Jim.
So was that French gunner who touched off the ball... ...that blew that old leg of mine overboard.
You served in the navy, my man?
Aye, aye, sir.
Under Admiral Hawke, off Biscay.
Under the immortal Hawke?
Aye, aye, sir.
Are there many one-legged seafaring men?
Why, the country's full of them, matey.
Just like storks on a roof.
Truly, Mr. Silver, I'm sorry for my bluntness.
Here, matey, you try this out.
Of course, you realize we can only sign on able-bodied men.
Oh, bless me, sir.
I didn't think when I came hobbling down here... ...that you'd have any use for this timber leg and me.
Oh, no, no.
Now, you don't happen to have... ...a cook onboard, do you?
Cook?
Why, no, not yet.
Well, squire, I own a little sailor's tavern up here, and I can make salt pork... ...taste just like roast pheasant.
Why, damn me, Silver, if you want the berth, you're hereby made ship's cook.
Silver, this port is full of the most unreliable men.
Of the dozen or so that I signed on, eight have never come back.
Disappeared entirely.
Oh, no.
Now, ain't that a shame.
I wonder what could have happened to them.
Shiftless idiots.
How many men might you be needing, squire?
I should like a round score of stout fellows, in case of savages or buccaneers.
Oh, now, you be scared of pirates, huh?
Well, Silver, one never knows.
Not presuming, sir, but I know every able-bodied seafaring man... ...in the town of Bristol.
What say you that I fetch a flock of them right down here to you?
Fetch them down.
Fetch them down, Silver.
Why, strike me pink.
We may get Smollett's entire crew for him... ...and be able to sail sooner, eh, Jim?
Aye.
Aye, aye, sir.
With your eye for seamen, sir...
Here, matey.
There you are.
Oh, sir, mayn't I go with Mr. Silver?
Well, Jim... Oh, no.
No, no, no.
There's a lot to be done.
But, sir, I want to go.
Please.
Oh, now, take the boy along, Silver.
Take him along.
Show him the port, the ships.
Start his education for him.
All right.
Come on, matey.
Come on.
That's the way it be, matey.
That's the way it be.
Then you surely would have been a captain if you hadn't lost your leg.
Come on, lads, come on.
Overboard with ye.
Oh, yes, I'd be captain.
I'd be captain, matey.
Here.
Help yourself to a boatswain's pipe.
There you are.
Here.
Thank you.
Let me show you how to blow it.
Oh, thank you, Mr. Silver.
Now you blow it.
This is my little inn, Jim, as I keep for sailors as ain't appreciated.
Mateys, this is Jim Hawkins, ship's boy off the 'Hispaniola'.
Hi there.
Aye, lad.
You might be glad to know that I've been made ship's cook.
Just friends, Jim.
All happy to know that old John's gonna get his health back.
They wouldn't be needing any other hands, would they, John?
Them as is worthy, George.
I've just been yarning with the ship's owner.
Maybe I can convince him of your high qualities, them as has them.
Oh, John.
That's the kind of joke, Long John.
Now, this here is Dandy Dawson.
A gentleman, is Dandy.
Took to the sea for the love of it, he says.
Wouldn't harm a cockroach.
Your servant, sonny.
My pleasure, Mr. Dawson.
And this is William O'Brien.
Now, William is a lay reader in the church, is William.
Lost his ear defending a woman.
A maid in Santiago that he had taken unto his heart, as it were.
As it were, sonny.
Bless my soul.
And, matey, this is Israel Hands.
Ugly Israel, we calls him, but as honest a man as you'll find in the room, Jim.
My pleasure, Mr.
Hands.
You come on a fair breeze, Master Hawkins.
Where's John?
Stop him!
Stop him!
Here, here.
Jim, Jim, Jim.
Here, here.
Who is he?
It's Black Dog.
Who?
Black Dog?
Who?
What's he done?
He was one of the buccaneers... A buccaneer?
Not one of the pirates that Squire Trelawney was telling us about?
Yes.
He ought to be caught.
Now, have any of you ever seen the likes of him before?
No, John.
He ain't a friend of anybody in here, be he?
No.
No, John.
That's good.
That's good for all of you.
If I ever catch any of you running alongside the likes of that, why, I'll... A scurvy pirate in my inn.
You wait here, matey.
I'll run and get me sea bag and me bird.
And we'll go right up and tell the squire about this.
Blimey.
Pirates.
Those are pretty boots, Master Hawkins.
Yes.
My mother gave them to me before I left.
And the same size our foot is.
Alike as two sister craft.
Yes.
I'm fond of pretty things, I am.
Yes.
Oh, a parrot.
Yes, matey.
If any of you wants a voyage, you go right down to the 'Hispaniola'.
She's lying in Wolf's Wharf.
Is it a boy or a girl parrot?
No, Jim, a girl, and usually a well-mannered little wench, too, says I.
Pieces of eight, pieces of eight, pieces of eight, pieces of eight.
Upon my word, she's a good talker.
Well, I wouldn't say "good," Jim, but powerful.
What's her name?
Captain Flint, I calls her.
Here, matey.
You take her for a spell.
She likes you, Jim.
But does she bite?
No, no.
Nary a nibble.
I thought most parrots liked to bite.
Not this one.
She's a lovebird, matey.
You know, I've been thinking about the squire, matey.
Yes, Mr. Silver.
You just call me Long John.
Yes, Long John.
You know, I don't think... ...that we ought to tell him about that Black Dog, now, do you?
Well, why not?
Well, the squire is very excitable.
He's got a lot on his mind, now, ain't he?
Well, yes.
Well, now, we didn't catch Black Dog, and there's nothing can be done... ...about it, is there?
Well, I know, but... Well, now, there's Admiral Hawke.
I remember in a battle off of Lisbon... ...why, a young lieutenant tells him something without using his judgment... ...and do you know what happened?
Why, that admiral fell in a fit... ...and pink foam oozed out of his ears for 42 days.
Out of his...?
All that time?
Yes, sirree.
Just like two spigots... ...out of a barrel of ale.
So just for the peace of the mind of the squire, why, we won't tell him, huh?
I believe you're right, Long John.
Matey, you're just smart as paint.
Why, you and me's gonna get along just fine in my galley.
She did bite me.
Now, ain't that too bad.
Well, matey, I guess she ain't used to you.
She's a little bit jealous, yeah.
I guess you don't want to leave old Long John alone, do you?
You... Just a little kiss, matey.
Yes.
You clam brain.
Is a crew always happy like that when they leave a port?
A good crew, Jim.
You know, if this voyage were a rainbow... ...and there was a pot of gold at the other end... ...they couldn't be any happier.
I'm glad you like Dr. Livesey.
Now, he's a pretty smart man, Jim.
He's not a sailor, of course.
But he can cut you open and sew you up again.
Well, that sewing up must be pretty difficult.
So is the cutting-up part.
Yeah, well, experience, Jim.
I couldn't do it.
Oh, no.
Neither could I. I'd swoon like a lady of quality, I would.
I guess I'm kind of sensitive-like.
To the squire, with my compliments, Jim.
Mulled wine, sir, with Long John's compliments.
And Silver forgets nothing.
Along with me, he's going to be certain... ...that this is a voyage that we shall all remember.
Long John's a wonderful man, sir.
Livesey, I give you...
Yes, yes, yes, yes?
Captain Smollett.
All well, I trust.
Everything shipshape and seaworthy?
I may as well speak plain, gentlemen, at the risk of offense.
I don't like this voyage.
That's short and sweet.
Pray explain yourself, sir.
I was signed on under sealed orders... ...to sail this ship wherever you'd bid me.
But I've arrived at the conclusion that every hand before the mast... ...knows more about the voyage than I do.
I don't call that fair.
Do you?
Certainly not.
What do the men know?
That we're going after treasure.
Oh, mind you, I've heard it whispered on all sides.
So has my officer, Mr. Arrow.
Livesey, I never uttered a word.
It must have been either you or the boy here.
Oh, upon my word, sir, I never...
So treasure it is, I see.
You mean you don't trust the crew?
Oh, some of them may be honest.
British naval heroes, all of them.
Yes, when there's treasure in the hole, there's fire in the forecastle.
So I'm taking certain precautions before we sail.
And by your leave, I'd ask you gentlemen to help me.
Lay forward on the quarterdeck.
Two inches off those points, boatswain.
Aye, aye, captain.
Captain, sir, what are we to make of this?
Why, me and Dick and Allan...
I never had me knife broke afore, captain.
It's a habit of mine on long voyages.
Sometimes hands get restless.
Captain's right, Jim.
Honest hands never object to having their knives tipped.
Boatswain, take the larboard watch.
Have the powder moved out of this forehold back under the aft cabin.
Aye.
Larboard watch.
Spring the hatch to the forehold.
Captain, that means that I'll have to move all my provision.
I stored them aft especially so the vegetables wouldn't get mildewed.
My orders, man.
You get to your galley.
The hands will want their dinner.
Aye, aye, captain.
Well, why do you men stand here?
Do as you're told.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Well?
No sign of arms, sir.
You gentlemen are determined to make this cruise?
Like iron, sir.
Weigh anchor, Mr. Arrow.
Aye, aye, sir.
Now, here, matey.
What's to do?
The captain ordered us to move our bunks aft.
With the gentlemen, huh?
That's fine, Jim.
Oh, but I'd rather be forward with you.
Well, how's this: Supposing I ask the captain to change bunks with me.
That is, after we settles down to sail.
Here, you, ship's boy.
Get along with that.
I'll have no favorites aboard my ship.
If there's one honest man aboard, it's Captain Smollett.
Honest, if you will, but an intolerable humbug.
I consider his conduct unmanly, unsailorly and downright un-English.
Bless my soul.
Why does the captain have to bellow at me?
Captain's ways, Jim.
Captain's ways.
Now, I wonder what could have thrown the captain into such a sudden squall, matey.
Oh, well, he wanted to...
I don't know.
I wish you were the captain of this ship, Long John.
I'll wager you could handle this boat better than he could.
No, matey, the captain's a man of wisdom.
A lot of brains.
Too bad an uneducated seamen can't open his head and see... ...just what he's got in it.
We're moving.
Well?
Well, Mr. Arrow?
She's breaking clear.
Haul the halyards around.
Set the jibs.
All right.
Set the topsails.
Set the guards and royals.
Belay that canary piping and tip us a man's stave.
Long John likes it.
And I likes rum, I does.
Lord, for a mouthful.
Is he serving rum aft?
The squire likes his spirits of an evening.
And he likes Valencian lace around his throat, he does.
I'm partial to Valencian lace meself.
A tender spot, the throat.
Starboard a bit, matey.
She's luffing.
She almost got away from you that time.
I was looking at old Nicodemus.
He follows us until he gets what he's after.
Well, we've given him plenty of potato peelings.
That won't do for old Nicodemus.
He's used to following slave ships.
Bless me, the ocean's full of death.
But it's cured your lungs... ...hasn't it, Long John?
Lungs, matey?
Yes, you've not coughed in a long time.
Yeah.
They're much better, more shipshape now.
What are you gonna do after this voyage?
Oh, I'll go back to that little old roof, I reckon.
Well, would you like to come and live with me?
With you, matey?
Yes.
You see, I'll have a lot more money.
And, well, I mean... ...there's only Mother and me.
And we've a nice room with a sea view... ...and sea air coming in from three sides.
And you could always be... No, no, matey.
I couldn't.
I just... Well, anyhow, you can come and visit us.
We'll always be mates, won't we?
Certain, we will.
Certain, we will.
No, matey, never spit to windward.
It'll ebb back on you.
Always spit to the leeward.
It sails like a gull.
That's right, matey.
Look, Mr. Arrow's drunk again.
The captain's got the key to the grog, Jim.
Where'd you get it?
Just seasick.
Sick?
You're drunk.
Why, sir, I haven't had a drink... You're drunk.
If it occurs again, you'll lie in the brig.
Where'd you get the rum?
Why, sir, I haven't had a drink.
You get below before I cane you.
Here, you two.
Silver, what are you doing here in the poop?
Boatswain, take this wheel.
Aye, aye.
Captain, for the lad's sake, Mr. Arrow says... To blazes with Mr. Arrow.
You get forward, where you belong.
Aye, aye, sir.
Aye, sir.
Good morning, Mr. Arrow, sir.
How's for a cup of tea this morning?
A powerful lover of tea you are, Mr. Arrow.
Yet I hopes I'm the one that serves you your last cup, sir.
Well?
He ain't nowhere aft, sir.
He ain't in the forecastle.
Poor Mr. Arrow.
And he stopped by me galley only last night, sir, for a breath of fresh air.
Still drunk, you say?
His weakness was still upon him, sir.
Old Nicodemus isn't with us anymore.
Arrow must have lurched overboard.
That settles it.
I'm sorry, sir.
This will leave you short-handed, captain.
I'll have it entered in the log.
That's all, men.
So why should I join?
Join up with what?
But, Henry, lookie... Astern of me, you little runt.
I don't like you and others of your kind who've come aboard this ship.
William... ...Henry doesn't seem happy aboard this ship.
You won't fall, Henry.
I be right here below you.
Oh, look.
Is that another shark?
Oh, no.
That's a porpoise.
That's a seaman's friend.
Look, there's a whole school of them.
They wouldn't eat anybody?
Oh, no, matey.
Porpoises off the bow is a good sign.
A successful voyage, they say.
Why, they comes right out from port and escorts you right in.
I guess nobody knows where we're heading to but the porpoises and the squire...
...I'll wager.
O'Brien, you were aloft with him.
How'd it happen?
I don't know, sir.
A bit choked up I be, sir.
Henry was my friend.
He swooned, like, and fell like a plummet.
Poor Henry.
Leastwise he'll never know what struck him.
I'm thankful for that.
Boatswain.
Aye, sir.
Prepare this body for burial.
Prepare the body for burial.
Land ho!
Land ho!
Where away?
Here, here, here.
Livesey, it's irreverent, but, damn me, come, sir.
Gray.
Where?
There it be, right under the cloud bank!
There she be.
Where?
Look, right there, underneath that cloud there.
Bless my soul.
Bless everybody's soul, matey.
It's it!
Gadzooks, Livesey, if it isn't it!
The spot seems on the side of a hill.
Rotten to the core.
Jim, run out to the apple barrel and fetch us some good ones.
My pleasure, sir.
Tomorrow, Livesey, tomorrow.
We'll land at dawn... ...and we'll have the doubloons by sundown.
You're as smart as paint to join up, Dick.
Aye, Dick listened the minute he heard there was treasure.
Don't you know the exact spot it's buried, now you're here?
Flint saw to that.
He left his ship in the same place as we're anchored.
He took the treasure and six brave lads and went ashore.
And when he came back, he came back alone.
"Dead men don't bite nor tell no tales," says he.
Well, I'm with you.
How about the others?
Oh, you mean Gray and Allan and...?
Oh, they be stupid souls.
Well, we'll talk to them.
Now, lookie, John, now we're here... ...how long are we gonna stand off and on like a blessed bumboat?
When do we strike, John?
The last minute that I can manage, that's when.
We could all steer a course for home, but who's to set one?
Captain Smollett's a good navigator, he will.
They takes the map, gets the treasure, brings it aboard.
Captain Smollett takes us out into the trade winds... ...and then one day, they all disappear overboard.
Result of a very heavy storm at sea.
Like Flint ye be, John.
And the flower of the flock was Flint.
Hey, Dick, you're a nice lad.
Get me an apple out of that barrel to sweeten my pipe with, will you?
Silver.
Silver.
Silver.
George Merry and the others is breaking out arms.
Now, I told them you was against it.
Why, the fools.
Aye.
This molasses is sweeter than Silver said it'd be.
Ephraim, look-see if that box of prunes don't turn into powder and ball.
Who smuggled these arms aboard this ship?
I did.
I'll tell you when to break them out.
And that's the whole awful story, sir.
I wish I'd only dreamt it.
There's your lighthearted crew for you.
Captain Smollett, I own myself an utter ass.
I await your orders.
What beats me is how they've been held in check so remarkably.
With your permission, captain, that's Silver.
A very remarkable man.
Yes, he'd look remarkably well swinging from a yardarm, sir.
Easy, Jim.
Steady, boy.
You may have been the means of saving the lot of us.
Don't flounder now.
I'm not afraid.
Let's see, there are seven of us, including young Hawkins here.
We were nine.
What's the first move?
Silver's anxious to conceal everything and hold on.
I'm anxious to give him the chance.
So we'll send the crew ashore alone.
It's my idea they'll be glad to go.
Think they'll bark their shins on the treasure.
If they all go, we up anchor and run with the ship.
If none go, we'll try and hold this cabin, and God defend the right.
Redruth, you load and distribute those muskets.
If only a few go ashore... ...you mark my word, Silver will bring them back, as mild as lambs.
Come and get your sidearms, gentlemen.
Come on, Jim.
You can spy out a lot more for us.
Exactly, boy.
They trust you.
Why, you and Silver have been great friends.
I know.
Why, we were mates, and we were gonna hunt goats together.
I even asked him to live with me.
He was the best friend I knew.
He gave me this.
I never knew anybody like him before.
But I know him now.
Certain, I do.
Ship's cook means luck ashore, mates.
Shove off, lads.
Silver has left six men.
One of them might be honest.
Jim!
Who told you to come along?
Well, nobody.
I just... Hey, what?
Jim!
Come here.
Wait for me, matey.
Jim?
You hear me?
Jim!
You come back here!
Hunter, did Jim go ashore?
Why, yes, sir.
I thought it was part of the plan, sir.
Gentlemen, this is bad business.
Now, come now, Tom.
You haul to and think it over.
What are you telling me, John Silver?
I'll not listen to the likes of that.
Now, be off.
I don't want my rigging fouled with mutiny.
I'm an honest seaman, you hear?
Yeah, I'll lay to that... ...but, Tom, you're smart as paint.
Why, I knew that the minute I clapped eyes on you.
You ain't gonna let honesty stand in the way of being smart, are you?
In heaven's name, what was that?
That?
I reckon that be Allan.
So you killed Allan, have you?
Well, rest his soul for a true seaman.
But kill me if you can.
I defies you.
That's two.
Not Jim.
They wouldn't do...
They'll do anything now.
Our only chance is to... Stay below there, you men.
Get back in that hold.
We've got to abandon ship.
Load the jollyboat with all the provisions and powder she'll carry.
You men get that boat in the water and get it loaded up.
Why abandon ship?
They've shown their hand.
When they come back, they'll board it.
They've killed two men already.
We're next.
Can't we hold them off?
With these swine at our backs?
If we tried to hold that aft cabin, they'd burn it.
We've got to get to Flint's blockhouse.
If that stockade is still standing, we can at least make a fight of it.
Gray!
Abraham Gray!
We're about to leave this ship.
I think you're an honest man.
If you wanna do your duty, come out and follow me.
I'm with you, sir.
Good man.
Lay aft and help with the boat.
Aye, sir.
Don't shoot.
Don't shoot.
Who are you?
I'm Ben Gunn.
I'm poor old Ben Gunn.
And I haven't spoken to a Christian these three years.
Three years?
Were you shipwrecked?
Nay, mate.
Marooned.
Marooned three years agone.
And I lived on oysters and berries and goats.
My heart's sore for Christian diet.
You mightn't happen to have a piece of cheese about you, now?
No.
"No," says you?
Well, says I, many a long night I dreamed of cheese.
It's toasted, mostly.
Then I wake up again, and here I were.
Well, if I ever get aboard again, you shall have some.
Well, now, what's to hinder you getting aboard now?
Ain't old Flint's ship, be it?
Oh, no.
Flint's dead.
But most of his hands are aboard her.
Worse luck for us.
Not a one-legged man?
You mean Silver?
If you was sent by Long John, I'm just the same as pork, and I know it.
But who are the rest you spoke about, matey?
Well, there's Dr. Livesey and Squire Trelawney and the captain.
Squires and doctors, says you?
Gentlemen born, says I.
That's different.
Have they showed themselves ashore yet?
No.
Lively, doctor, lively!
This is the last trip.
So after I was on Flint's ship, I was on another ship.
That was three years back, and we spied this island.
"Lads," says I, "there's where old Flint's treasure's buried.
Let's land and find it."
Twelve days we hunts.
Every day they have worse words for me.
Till one fine morning, all hands got aboard.
"As for you, Benjamin Gunn," says they... ..."you're so sure Flint's treasure's buried here... ...you can just stay and find it," says they.
"Now, was that a gentlemanly thing to do," says you?
Well, did you find it?
That's what your squires and doctors would like to know, says I.
"Yes," says you?
Snug in behind that rock, Jim, is my little skin boat and paddle... ...as I made it with my own hands.
You takes it, paddles out, finds the squire and tells him... ...that Ben Gunn puts a heap sight more confidence... ...heap sight, mind you... ...in gentlemen born than gentlemen of fortune.
And then you nips him on the cheek like I does you.
Why?
And then you tells him... ...that Ben Gunn will meet him on this hill.
He's to come alone with a white thing in his hand.
Upon my word, I don't know what you're talking about... ...but I'll tell the squire and doctor everything that you said.
They've be...
They've begun to fight.
Who's the best shot here?
Mr. Trelawney, out and away.
Pick me off one of those pirates, if you please, sir.
Move sharply, move sharply.
There.
Hand me that ball.
That's a score snood!
Come on, my boys.
Stay to your oars, Gray.
He's gone.
We've got to beach this boat or she'll swamp.
Larboard.
Larboard a little.
We're swamped here, lads.
Hold to your muskets.
Jim, thank heaven you're safe.
Up, lads.
Abandon that boat.
Stockade's our only chance.
It's them after-cabin blokes!
They're making for the stockade.
Come on, lads, head them off.
Belay that.
Belay that, you swabs!
They'll shoot you down like a lot of gulls.
Get to those gigs and get back to that ship.
Come on, lads.
Shoot away, me lads.
That's the way to waste powder.
The flag spots the house for them.
Hadn't we better lower it?
Lower the flag?
Strike my colors?
Not I, sir.
We've little provisions, but we've plenty of powder and ball.
And by heaven, sir, this spot is England.
Stockade, ahoy!
It's Silver himself.
I feel this may be a trick.
Doctor, take charge of your watch.
Gray.
Joyce.
What do you want with your flag of truce?
Captain Silver, sir, wants to come aboard to make terms.
Captain Silver?
Who's he?
I never heard of him.
Me, sir.
Me.
The poor lads have chosen me their captain since your desertion, sir.
What's your course, Silver?
One minute's talk with you.
I've no desire to talk with you.
If you wanna come over here, come.
But if there's any treachery, it'll be on your side, and Lord help you.
That word from you is enough, sir.
I knows a gentleman when I lays eyes on him, you can lay to that.
Joyce, take the doctor's place.
Well, well, well.
Here we are all together again, just like one big, happy family.
Top of the morning to you, Jim.
I'd rather you'd sit down, Silver.
Sit down and toss away that crutch if you're talking to me.
Come, out with it, man.
What do you want?
We want the treasure.
We're gonna have it.
You want your lives, that's yours.
Well, you can have that if you give us Flint's chart.
I'd see you and the whole island blown to blazes first.
Well, that... That's an idea.
You give me the chart... ...and the moment the treasure's onboard, we'll take you along with it.
And I'll give you my affidavit, upon my word and honor... ...that we'll set you down safe and sound at the first point of civilization.
That's on your word of honor.
My affidavit, gentlemen.
And a handsomer one you couldn't hope to look at.
That all?
Every last word, by thunder.
Good.
Now you hear me.
You come back here, one by one, unarmed... ...and I'll guarantee to put you in irons, take you to England and get you a fair trial.
If you refuse, my name is Alexander Smollett...
...I've flown my sovereign's colors... ...and I'll see you all to Davy Jones.
That final?
That's the last good word... ...you'll hear out of me, by heaven.
The next time we meet, I'll put a bullet in you.
Do you meet my terms?
No.
Then tumble out of here, me lad.
Hand over hand, on the double.
Give me a hand up.
I'd sooner touch carrion.
Who'll give me a hand up?
Before the hour's up, I'll crush your blockhouse... ...like it was a puncheon.
Them of you that dies will be lucky.
Inside.
Clear decks for action.
Quarters, all hands.
They'll board us in a minute.
Now, get over that wall first, and don't use your muskets only as the last resort.
Morgan, you and yours to the larboard.
Job, you and yours to the starboard.
Now, by the powers, board them.
Here they come, captain!
Fire when they top the wall.
Another load, Jim.
More loads, Hawkins.
Come, boy.
Trelawney, sir, you're a man.
And you're a captain, sir.
At them, you dogfish!
At them!
Outside, lads.
Outside and fight them in the open.
Cutlasses.
Lively, lively, lads.
My compliments, Mr. Gray.
I've been looking for this.
Inside the house, lads.
They've gone.
Fire from cover.
You crawling squid.
You dogfish.
Don't mind me, sir.
Watch them.
They've turned tail for the moment.
My case, Jim.
Hunter and Joyce are dead, sir.
My case, Jim.
Captain Smollett has a ball in his shoulder.
Oh, yes.
God rest Hunter and Joyce.
Amen.
How many did they lose?
Seven.
They've had their rations for today.
Well, that makes them nine against our five, gentlemen.
Precious sight more confidence, eh?
Yes, sir.
Here's Gray.
Well?
Well, Gray?
They're all camped down by the swamp.
I heard them.
They're like hornets, and Silver's the maddest.
It looks like tomorrow will finish us.
What's in the wind?
They're building rafts and floating the cannon in from the ship.
Silver says he's going to blow this blockhouse to limbo.
That settles it.
This Ben Gunn may be our last chance.
You sure he's all right in the head?
Well, he's rather silly, sir.
He told me to nip the squire.
Nip me?
How?
Begging your pardon, sir, like this.
A lunatic.
No harm in finding out.
I have two hours before dawn.
I'll haunt that clearing all day.
It'll take them all day to get that gun ashore.
If they turn up again, God be with you, gentlemen.
Godspeed, doctor.
Good luck, doctor.
What's the doctor up to?
Oh, he thinks this Ben Gunn fellow can help us.
How is beyond me.
Says he, says them, says I, says nothing.
We can't hold out against cannon, Smollett.
If we could only get out and cut that ship adrift... ...that'd put an end to the cannon.
Cut off their base of supplies.
We've no boat.
They're undoubtedly watching the gigs.
I know, I know.
The doctor's right.
Our only chance is this Gunn fellow.
Keep near the house, Jim.
Oh, yes, sir.
It's just hot in here, sir.
Go on, make your play.
Make your play, I says!
Let's talk.
Silver's tangled everything, I tell you.
Stow that drunken guff and make your play.
I be'n't drunk, and Silver's a fool.
You're the fool, William.
And your face fair makes me bilious, it does.
Fool, bilious, eh?
We're adrift!
Adrift we be!
Why, the anchor's gone!
The hawser's parted!
Up with the jib, we'll swing into the reef.
Come aboard, Mr.
Hands.
Much hurt?
Not the way poor dear William be.
He wasn't much of a sailor, was William.
Where might you come from?
I've come aboard to take possession of this ship, Mr.
Hands... ...and you can regard me as captain until further notice.
Well, now, Captain Hawkins... ...and who's to sail her, without you get the hint from me?
Well... Now, look here... ...you give me me food and me drink... ...and a bit of a scarf or a handkerchief to bind up me wound with... ...and I'll show you how to sail her.
Now, that's square all round, ain't it?
Done, Mr.
Hands.
Now, I can't have these colors, Mr.
Hands... ...and by your leave, I'll strike them.
God save the king, and there's an end to Captain Silver.
Now your wound, Mr.
Hands.
I won't be forgetting about this, Captain Hawkins.
And where might we be a-sailing to?
Not back to the anchorage, you can be sure.
I've seen a map of this island.
Do you know a cove called North Inlet?
That I do.
It's a way north, on the other shore, it be.
Well, that's where we're sailing to.
I'm gonna run her high and dry on the beach... ...where nobody will be able to find her excepting honest people.
Now, does that suit your curiosity, Mr.
Hands?
Why, Captain Hawkins, under my present unfortunate circumstances... ...to a plum.
Aye, she's headed right now.
Right, captain.
Now lash the wheel and come forward for a close haul on the jib.
Right.
It's been a tiresome voyage.
Why, you can stand.
And I can walk too.
Perhaps you'll be needing a little rest, Captain Hawkins.
Wet powder, Captain Hawkins.
One more step, Mr.
Hands, and I'll blow your brains out.
Dead men don't bite, you know.
I reckon you and me will have to sign articles, Jim.
I'd have had you but for that lurch there.
I don't have much luck, not I.
It looks like I'll have to... Dr. Livesey.
Dr. Livesey.
Pieces of eight.
Well, if it ain't Jim Hawkins.
Dropped in sort of friendly-like, huh?
What have you done with my friends?
Have you killed them?
Oh, no.
Blood spilling's all over, Jim.
We signed a treaty, Jim.
Treaty?
What kind of a treaty?
Well, we give them their freedom out of here in return for half of their provisions.
But where did they go?
Oh, they just wandered away.
But if you're of mind to hunting them up, why, you just save your time, Jim... ...because they don't want to have nothing to do with you.
You're lying.
No, Jim.
Why, the squire told me right to my face that you was a deserter... ...and the doctor... Oh, the doctor said that you was scared.
But they couldn't think that.
They wouldn't, not after...
Naturally, I've always wanted you to join up with us and take your share.
Now it looks like you'll have to.
Well, supposing I said no.
Well, even if you do get the treasure... ...your ship's lost, your men lost, your whole business gone to wreck.
If you want to know who did it, it was I.
You, Jim?
I was in the apple barrel that night and heard you.
I cut the ship's hawser and killed those two aboard her... ...and I took her where you'll never see her again, none of you.
Kill me if you want, but the laugh's on my side, and I'll die laughing at the lot of you.
I believe you would, matey.
He faked the map from Billy Bones.
First and last we've been fouled by him.
Avast there!
Be you captain here, Morgan?
Tom's right.
I'm the captain...
...I say what's right.
I'll be hanged if I'll be hazed by you, John... You want to have it out with me?
That's better, George Merry.
Why, this boy's got more fight in him than the whole of you.
I like this boy... ...and if you understand King George's English... ...you better not lay a hand on him.
Well, you makes a hash of this cruise.
You're a bold man to say no to that.
And second, there's that boy.
He's earned a proper killing.
In the third place, you wouldn't let us attack them, and they on the march.
And fourth, you let the enemy out of this trap for nothing.
Oh, we get the stores and the powder... ...but we didn't get the map, did we?
And what do we want here except for the map, I'd like to know.
Quiet, by George!
By thunder, it's it.
Look: "J.F."
Flint's initials, with a score below and a clove hitch.
Good old Silver!
Long John forever!
Aye, Silver!
Hurrah for Silver.
Where'd you get the map?
From Dr. Livesey, matey.
You couldn't have gotten it unless you killed them.
No.
That's part of the bargain, matey.
They gets their freedom and we gets the treasure.
Will you join me in a bit of fresh air, matey?
There's so much stupidity in here that I can't breathe properly.
Come on.
Guess that ends everything, now that you've got the map.
No, matey, you've still got a chance for a share.
No, I thank you... ...but I want you to know I'm grateful for you defending me.
Now I best go and hunt up my friends.
Goodbye.
Here, you better stay here for a spell.
Maybe the squire and the doctor have had a little change of heart about you.
Well, yes, but... Well, I might need you for a hostage.
Come on, sit down.
Hostage?
What do you need a hostage for?
You said you'd made a treaty.
Well, treaties are only good until you find a chance to break them, matey.
That isn't very honorable.
It's smart, Jim.
You see what being honorable done for me?
I had to show them the map, didn't I?
Well, why were you keeping it from them?
There's too many of them to share the treasure with.
I just trying to figure a way to get rid of about half of them.
Oh, I see.
More murders.
Oh, no, not murder.
Tactics.
I recall taking a prize ship off of Peru once... ...and there was too many of them to share the treasure with... ...so Flint and me, we waits till all hands are asleep...
I don't wish to hear about it.
All right, Jim.
Well, what did you do with them?
Flint, he has a little hammer, so we go around to all the bunks... ...and we get in back of the men and then we... Never mind.
I don't wish to hear about it.
Oh, all right.
It ain't important.
We only disposed of 13 men.
Blockhouse, ahoy.
What about it, Silver?
Have you seen anything of Jim Hawkins?
Why...
Here I am, Dr. Livesey.
Thank heaven you're safe.
Let me talk with him.
No, by the powers.
They'll pull a trick.
Please.
I'll be telling you for the last time, George Merry, you drop his arm.
You give me your word of honor that you won't slip your cable, Jim?
I do.
Well, all right, then.
We'll go down and have a yarn with the good doctor.
Dr. Livesey.
Where did you all go?
Why did you give up to them?
All I can tell you now is that we're safe and sound.
But where did you go, lad?
We searched everywhere.
Then you didn't think I deserted you, sir, and that I was scared?
Not a thought of it, lad.
You said that they said I was scared, that they didn't want me.
Well, matey, I thought it would be easier for you to join up that way.
Oh, I didn't join, sir.
Truly, I didn't.
But where did you go, Jim?
What...?
I ran away to cut the ship's hawser, like Captain Smollett wanted.
I have her beached at North Inlet now, sir.
North Inlet, eh?
Float her and get her away from here.
Don't mind about me.
One budge of your hand, Silver, and I fire.
Quick, now.
Quick, Jim.
Whip over the wall and run for it.
Oh, no, sir, I passed my word... What's your word to these scoundrels?
Quick, head for cover.
Sir, it was my word of honor, no matter whom it's to.
I can't break it.
A lad of honor.
I counted on that, sir.
Jim, we won't leave this island without you, my word on that.
You're going for the treasure now, eh?
There where we be going.
Well, mark you, Silver: When you find it, prepare for squalls.
And if Jim Hawkins here is so much as scratched... ...there'll be a ball between your eyes that nobody will bother to remove.
Squalls, eh, matey?
Am I off my course and sitting on a waterspout?
I'd almost wager.
East-southeast... ...two points east.
I thought so.
Just as the chart says.
Why, that's one of the six brave lads that Flint killed... ...and laid their bones right in a line with the treasure.
There's five more of them ahead between us and the doubloons.
Forward.
Darby McGraw!
Darby McGraw!
Hark, ye.
Darby McGraw!
Darby McGraw!
That's him, I tell you.
I've heard Flint calling Darby a hundred times.
Fetch aft the rum!
Them was his last words aboveboard.
That fixes it.
I'm done.
Where might I hear that voice afore?
Nobody but us on this island knows them words.
That's Flint's spirit.
Nothing but flesh and blood can talk.
I was never afeard of Flint alive, and I ain't scared to face him dead.
Come on, if you're coming.
There it be, mates, right in the clearing there.
At it, mates.
All together.
Why, there's nothing there at all.
Nothing, Jim.
We've been out-sailed.
Here, Jim.
Take that and stand by for trouble.
Two guineas.
That's your 700,000 pounds, is it?
Why don't you dig a little deeper, lads.
Maybe you'll find radishes and turnips.
It's only an old cripple and a boy.
Let's settle it.
Let them have it.
That'll hold them for good and all, Gray.
Dr. Livesey, where did you come from?
How did you happen...?
We thought we'd be useful, Jim.
Look, sir, there's no treasure at all.
We've come all this way and everybody's been killed for nothing.
Upon my word, sir, I don't understand it.
Well, don't try, Jim.
We'll go up to Ben Gunn's cave.
Maybe old Ben's got another trick in his beard.
Beard?
Cave?
Upon my word, sir.
Thank ye kindly, doctor, and quite a squall it were.
By the powers.
That voice.
So it be you, Ben Gunn.
How do you do, Mr. Silver?
"Pretty well, I thank you," says you.
Ben, Ben.
To think as you've done me.
Gray, lead the way with Jim.
March, Silver.
You'll find as how you've been done by everybody.
Well, have you had enough action, me lad?
No, thank you.
Keep going, keep going.
Why, bless my soul...
But... What's...?
Upon my soul, how did it all get here?
All found and carried up here with my own hands, says I.
"Very thoughtful," says you?
And you can be full of cheese from now on, says I.
"Yes," says you?
Yes, says I.
Be it all here, Ben Gunn?
You don't be holding out any on us, now, be you?
Mr. Silver, says I.
Silver.
Aye, aye, sir.
Well, captain, I reports back to duty.
Me and Jim played a powerful trick on them.
Now that we all have the treasure, why, we're all one big, happy family.
We've got the treasure.
We.
You're going back to stand trial in England for mutiny and murder, my man.
Look, Jim.
Rubies with fire in them.
Them's pretty harsh measures.
Pretty strong medicine, captain, for just a little infraction of the rules.
Not nearly so harsh or strong... ...as the rope I hope to see you hanging from at Execution Dock.
You're under arrest, Silver.
'Hispaniola' ahoy!
Ahoy!
Ahoy!
Don't leave me!
Don't leave me, I'll stand trial!
We'll starve.
We'll starve!
You had your chance, my friends.
We'll pick up a new crew at Jamaica.
Did the frigate answer our signal?
She says, "Come aboard, Hampton commanding."
Good.
Ben Gunn, stay alert, now.
We want no strange craft alongside.
Aye, sir.
A British ship of the line.
And tomorrow we may have the pleasure of seeing Silver... ...hanging to a yardarm.
Well, Jim, do you come to take old John aloft for a breather?
No.
I fetched you this instead.
Thank ye, matey, but I ain't much for spirits.
Well, I thought you might like to start and drink a lot of it.
Why?
Well, doesn't everybody?
I mean, before they're hanged?
Hanged, matey?
They went over to a frigate that's lying here.
They're not gonna wait till we get to England.
Captain says we can hold a naval trial tomorrow... ...and the squire says we can see you swinging from a yardarm.
That ain't just exactly a breather, be it, Jim?
I'm sorry.
Truly, I am.
You say they all went over?
No, they left Ben Gunn on watch.
Well, Jim...
...I guess you'll have to stand on deck and watch me swing.
I can't bear the thought of it.
Of you, of anybody.
Oh, we won't think about that, Jim.
You just dies, and that's that.
Quite often, though, not as quick as people think, Jim.
Why not?
Well... ...you take my case, as it were.
Now, there I'll be, way out on that yardarm.
Way out there with a rope around my neck.
And then they gives the orders to jump.
And when the average man jumps and reaches the end of that rope... ...snaps his head around, way around like that.
That's the average man.
But of course, with me, it's a little bit different.
With my one leg, you see, I'd be kind of off-balance.
And if they didn't get that noose just right... ...right there, why, I'd probably just... ...slowly strangle and choke... ...just so I didn't swallow my tongue.
But that very rarely happens, Jim, swallowing the tongue.
Stop, stop!
There.
I don't know how you'll get by Ben Gunn... ...but you're free from here, at least.
Oh, that's my matey.
If ever the day comes that I can help you, why, I...
I'm going to... What's the matter?
I guess you'll have to help me up, matey.
It's my rheumatism.
This place is damp in here.
No, no, no.
I'm ticklish under my arm.
Thank ye, matey, thank ye.
Where's Ben Gunn?
Sitting up by the mizzenmast on guard.
You run aft and get me a pistol.
No, there'll be no blood spilled in this.
Oh, no, not for Ben Gunn.
Why, I can talk with Ben, he and me are old shipmates.
Just for protection on shore, you know.
It's a wild place, Jamaica.
All right.
But I told you, you mustn't.
Now, ain't that terrible?
He's left to guard a ship, and there he lays in a drunken stupor.
But he has a awful large bump on his head.
Well, he must have got that when he fell off of there... ...and hit the deck with his head.
Ain't that too bad.
Well, matey... What old Long John's got to tell you, he don't know how to say it.
I don't mean that you'll be forgiving me all the bad things that I've done... ...but just for the mateys that we might have been.
You won't be a pirate anymore, will you?
You won't steal?
No, sir.
From now on... ...my course is going to be a straight, honest one, so help me.
Why, shiver my timbers, I... Well, now, I'm glad that happened, matey.
That's just what I was trying to tell you, and I didn't know how.
I cut through the bulkhead, into where the treasure was... ...and took off just one sack of gold.
But you promised you wouldn't.
Well, I took that before I promised.
But it's off my conscience now... ...and the Lord knows my conscience won't stand any more, matey.
Well, here.
You may need it.
No, no, no, thanks.
But you have to buy food.
No, that's all right, Jim.
I'll get along all right.
I'll get along all right.
Well, matey...
Here.
Feed her good.
And put her... You put her down below decks when any women around, huh?
I will.
I promise I will.
Oh, belay that.
Don't do that.
Our courses will cross again sometime.
Lookie.
Lookie, now.
Now, you didn't get all of that bar silver on that island, now, did you?
No.
Well, who knows?
Maybe someday you'll have a great big ship.
Bigger than this one.
And you'll go down there and get the rest of that treasure, now, won't you?
And you might be needing a mate or a captain, huh?
I guess so.
All right.
And who do you think would come hobbling along for that berth... ...but old Long John Silver?
It'd be Honest Long John then.
And together, we'd go down there and dig up that treasure... ...and we'd scour all the seas for all the treasures on those islands.
And we'd hunt goats.
And fight cannibals.
It's true, matey.
Certain, we will.
Certain, we will.
1 If I could reach the top of the world Be all I am It'd be so beautiful If only I could be brave and I could be strong I would know where I belong If only I wanna feel free to be who I am What I'm about is more than I've been Ready to show the world who I am Oh!
A little bit of sun.
Oh, look!
Hey, Zarina!
Oh.
Out of pixie dust again, sug?
You know me, Rosetta.
I could give you some tips on conserving your supply.
I may just take you up on that, Dessa.
A Dust Keeper Fairy who's always out of pixie dust.
Ironic, isn't it?
Right there.
Nice.
Okay.
Rinse time!
Time to dry!
Hey, Z!
Wings okay?
Just enjoying a stroll.
But thanks, Fawn.
Nice wind, Vidia.
Thanks.
What's a "stroll"?
Oh, no!
So I could be who I am Yeah, yeah, yeah I'm closer to where I'm meant to be If I try I know that I can get there I'm not gonna stop 'cause I believe That there's so much more to me So much more I wanna feel free to be who I am What I'm about is more than I've been Ready to show the world who I am Started it out, but I'm holding in Find my own place to stay So I can be who I am Uh... We put the dust in the bags and they stay there, right?
And yet, we sprinkle dust on top of something, and it floats.
Well, that's just how pixie dust works.
Well, yes, I know, but "Why?"
is the question.
Know what I mean?
Not even a little?
Never once had the thought?
Good morning, Dust Keepers!
Oh!
Good morning, Fairy Gary!
All right, let's see.
On blue dust duty today we have, uh... What were we on?
"Y."
Ah!
Yes.
Yvette.
Yvette is out for the day, Fairy Gary.
Dust-Keeper elbow flared up again.
That's fantastic!
I mean, poor, poor Yvette.
Well, um, that brings us to... Zarina, you're up!
Uh-oh.
Can you believe it?
I mean, one day early.
It's so exciting!
Uh... Six clicks to the right.
Yes, thank you.
Wow.
Careful, now!
After last time, I'm sure I don't have to remind you just how potent and powerful... No touching, I promise.
Attagirl!
All right, then.
Exactly 26 specks.
But why 26?
And here we go.
Why not 25?
What would happen if we put in, say, 27?
We put in 26.
But why?
Ah, Zarina, you're the most inquisitive fairy I've ever known.
Correction, it's a tie.
Let's just say, you're the Tinker Bell of Dust Keepers.
But why do you say it like it's a bad thing?
Because we don't work with twigs and acorn caps.
We work with pixie dust.
It's our lifeblood.
There's no room for error.
Blue dust.
One of nature's mightiest multipliers.
It takes the golden dust from a trickle to a roar.
No matter how many times I see it, just... Wow!
Indeed.
Okay, but if there's blue dust, why can't there be other colors?
Because there aren't.
And maybe those other colors do other things.
What if there was, I don't know, purple?
What if there's pink?
The day someone finds pink pixie dust is the day I trade in my kilt for trousers.
Well, what if we don't find it?
What if we make it?
Listen carefully, Zarina.
We do not tamper with pixie dust.
It is far too powerful.
But if we don't, we'll never fully understand what it's capable of.
That is not our job.
We're Dust Keepers.
We nurture the dust, maintain it, measure it, package it, and distribute it.
A beautiful tradition, day in, day out, passed from one generation... ...to the next, to the next, to the next.
Oh!
Oh!
Ahh!
Oh, no!
Fairy Gary!
Are you okay?
Technically, I didn't touch it this time.
The cap?
Let me be absolutely clear, Zarina.
Dust Keepers are forbidden to tamper with pixie dust.
Hmm.
No result.
No result.
No result.
No result.
Ugh!
Huh?
Hmm.
Two parts sunflower seed, a dash of moonflower.
Huh.
It worked!
Oh!
Hey, Zarina!
What brings you... Tinker Bell... ...here?
Remember how you were the first one to use lost things, and everyone thought you were kind of crazy?
I believe Fairy Mary called them "junk."
Exactly!
But now, even she uses them and tinkering is better than ever.
Well, that's nice of... And remember how you crossed the Winter border when you knew it wasn't allowed, but you just had to anyway?
I like to think it was more of a grey area.
Good.
Now, keep that in mind.
Whoa!
You... You're bending light.
You're bending light?
But you're not a Light Fairy.
You're a Dust Keeper.
Amazing, right?
Uh, but, how?
Whoa!
You found orange pixie dust?
No, Tink.
I made orange pixie dust.
That's never been done before.
Exactly!
I knew you'd understand.
Now, I can finally figure out everything pixie dust is capable of.
Oh, what does Fairy Gary think about all this?
Uh...
He doesn't exactly know.
What?
He doesn't really think we should tamper with pixie dust.
Do you mind stirring?
Uh, okay.
I guess he thinks it's just too powerful.
Oh!
You can't stop.
Oh!
Uh... Is that blue dust?
You're doing this with blue dust?
Yes, and it just takes the tiniest bit.
Can you believe it?
Back up a little.
Uh... Huh.
Wow.
Purple pixie dust.
Wind!
Purple equals fast-flying talent!
Huh.
Uh... Garden talent next!
Uh... Zarina?
Pink pixie dust... Maybe you should, you know, slow down a bit.
Five pieces of petal for every three drops of extract.
Uh, should it be bubbling like that?
Mmm-hmm.
Two?
This time you're adding two?
Uh-huh.
Zarina!
Are you okay?
Tinker Fairy Gary some trousers, because I just made pink pixie dust.
Zarina, this seems kind of dangerous.
Do you know what this means, Tink?
I've finally found my "lost things."
Dust-keeping will change forever!
Zarina, I really think you should stop!
What?
Oh, no!
No, no, no, no, no.
Whoa!
Look out!
Huh?
Oh, no!
No!
OW!
Oh!
Oh, no!
Whoa!
Huh?
No... Hmm?
Oh!
How did this happen?
Oh, no!
What happened?
Tink, are you okay?
Oh, my.
Yeah.
Who grew these?
I'm so sorry.
I'll help rebuild the depot.
I'll come in early, I'll stay late!
You were told not to tamper with pixie dust.
I think it's best if you don't come in at all.
What are you saying?
You are no longer a Dust Keeper.
It's simply too dangerous.
We'll start rebuilding in the morning, Queen Clarion.
Welcome one, welcome all to the Four Seasons Festival!
Tonight, every talent from every season will gather together to celebrate all the realms of Pixie Hollow.
Wow!
Can you believe it?
Everyone in Pixie Hollow is here!
It's so great to have the Winter Fairies join us.
I'll say it is.
It's enough to give you the vapors.
Tinker Bell, don't you Tinkers ever stop tinkering?
Can't seem to get this latch to open!
It had better not stick like that for our grand finale.
Is it starting?
No, that's just Clank.
The thing is pretty loud, eh, Bobble?
Indeed, my bugling buddy.
Sure makes me thirsty, though.
It's starting!
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
Bobble... Oh, no!
Already?
Hold these!
But the show just started!
Ask them to wait!
Hey, guys, I can't see!
Oh!
It's Periwinkle!
Beautiful.
Oh, look at that.
Hi, Peri!
That's my sister.
All right!
Oh, wow!
Yeah!
Yay!
Go, fairies!
R0, did you do those?
That wasn't in rehearsal.
Wasn't me.
I never work with poppies.
The pollen makes me sleepy.
Wait.
Is that... Zarina?
Zarina?
Hmm.
She's back?
What's with that wild hair?
Oh, look at those flowers!
Ooh!
Spring must be next!
That's my favorite.
Oh, I hope Clanky doesn't miss it.
Oh!
Wow!
Oh!
Huh?
Oh, lovely!
Oh!
Guys, guys!
We gotta hide!
Oh!
Now, now, now!
They've really outdone themselves this year.
What a show.
Whoo!
Excuse me.
Sorry.
Yes, me again.
Coming through.
No, no, don't get up.
Oh, sorry, I should have flown.
Thank you, Bobble.
What did I miss?
Wake up!
Wake up!
Please!
Anyone?
Clank, help us!
Down here!
Clank!
In here!
In the box!
Oh!
Oh, oh... Ms. Bell?
Help, we're stuck.
Right.
How does it open?
Push the button!
Thank you so much.
You've got to see this.
Oh, no.
Are they... No.
Goodness, no.
They're in a deep sleep.
For how long?
At least a couple of days.
Why would Zarina do this?
Clank, did you see her?
No, no.
Yes, yes, I saw her flying towards the dust depot.
The blue pixie dust.
Ooh, this is bad.
Uh, yeah.
Without it, the tree can't make pixie dust.
And if the tree can't make pixie dust... We can't fly.
On!
Can't... Can't fly...
Deep breaths.
Can't fly...
Okay.
Okay.
That's it.
Deep breaths.
What could she want it for?
I don't know.
But we have to find her.
Clank, stay here and watch over everyone.
I'm on it.
Especially the Winter Fairies.
Make sure they get a steady stream of snow.
Right!
Right.
The blue dust has a strong glow.
If we can just spot it...
There!
Whoa, she's moving fast!
Oh, sorry!
Where is all this fog coming from?
It's mist.
We must be getting near the coast.
We're losing her!
Over there!
Oh, my!
Oh, no.
It's... Pirates.
Great, now there's pirates.
Maybe they're nice pirates.
Right.
They must have captured her, forced her to take the dust.
Well, we have to rescue her.
But they're...
Deep breaths.
Deep breaths.
Okay.
Hmm.
Magnificent!
Quite right.
A fine haul.
We got their blue dust!
Well, it's not theirs anymore.
It is theirs no longer.
I just said that, you daft potato muncher.
Potato...
They're holding her in the bottom of the boat.
You've got a right wee brain, you know that?
Still smart enough to know we got their dust!
Let me just say that your plan worked perfectly, Captain.
"Captain"?
Here's to perfect plans.
Ave!
Perfect!
Guess she doesn't need rescuing.
But now the hair makes sense.
What do we do now?
Let's just get the dust and get out of here.
A little bit of pillage, a little bit of plunder.
Oh!
Fairies!
Ahh!
Get her!
Get her!
Whoa!
Got it.
Here!
She's getting away!
They took the blue dust!
Captain!
Give me back that dust!
Zarina, why are you doing this?
Fawn!
If you give it to me, I'll give you quarter.
Quarter?
I think we need all of it.
"Quarter" means mercy!
Ooh.
This dust belongs to Pixie Hollow.
You had your chance.
Wake up.
Tink, wake up.
What happened?
The last thing I remember was Zarina throwing that dust at us.
Your dress.
I know.
Um... ls everyone all right?
I guess so.
I'm not.
Look at my outfit!
Orange is not my color.
She's right.
Listen, we have to get out of here and go after Zarina.
Silvermist, can you part the...
Shut it Off!
Shut it Off!
I didn't do anything.
I just... Tink!
Tink, could you stop not doing anything?
It's okay, I got this.
Whoa!
Silvermist, are you okay?
Whoa!
That's weird.
Here, let me help you.
It's so bright!
Bright!
Fawn, I can't see!
What did you do?
I don't know.
Ew, ew, ew, ew.
Get them off.
Get them off!
Get them off!
Get them off!
Wait a minute.
Do you realize what this means?
Oh, my gosh!
Zarina switched our heads!
No.
No, no, no.
She switched our talents.
Excuse me?
What?
I must be a Water Fairy now.
Oh, so, that's why your dress is blue.
And I guess you're a Fast-Flying Fairy.
I'm a...
I'm a Light Fairy.
Ow.
Garden Fairy!
Oh.
Looks like I'm an Animal Fairy now.
Huh.
Lucky me.
No, no, no, it can't be.
You're a... Don't say it.
Tinker Bell, take these things back right now!
Okay.
Tinker.
Guys, come on, we gotta get out of here.
Well, you're the Water Fairy.
Part the waters.
Um, use both hands this time.
Well, you don't see that every day.
You guys better hurry!
I can't hold it!
Oops!
Guys, are you... .okay?
Yeah.
Guys, I think I broke something.
Whoa!
Uh... Nice, little, harmless, sharp-toothed, hungry croco... dile.
Fawn!
It's okay.
When babies are born, they imprint on the first thing they see.
Uh, guys, sorry to interrupt whatever that is, but the pirate ship is gone.
What?
Oh, no.
Sil, Fast Flyer, check it out.
Oh, yeah.
Where is she?
You guys, I saw it, up the coast!
Let's go!
Oh, right, you can't fly.
Wet wings.
Still, there's got to be a way to... Ah!
Excuse me, Ro.
Hmm.
Structurally sound enough.
Strength-to-weight ratio seems good.
If I had some rope... Oh!
You're thinking like a Tinker.
Okay, fine.
Get me some vines.
Not a problem.
Will these do?
Okay, ready?
Wait for me!
Sorry.
Gotta... Can I please have that?
Oh!
Go!
There's the pirate ship!
You can slow down now!
Easy for you to say.
Hold on!
Well, at least our wings are dry.
Yeah.
Twenty-one gun salute to the captain!
Right, 21.
Nice boom!
Oh, yes!
Nice!
Ohh!
Music to my ear!
That's right!
Encore!
Beautiful!
Yes, yes, yes!
Cease fire!
What?
Cease fire?
What for?
That was only seven.
I say 21.
Right!
Twenty-one, obviously, on the metric system, which is fine.
Come on, we've got to find that dust.
If I may, good sirs, I believe the proper acknowledgment would be a toast.
A toast it is!
Now, there is a good cabin boy.
A beautiful suggestion.
Quite thirsty, myself.
Uh-uh!
If it pleases the captain.
You tell those scurvy scallywags that... What did she say?
She said, it does!
What is better than a good mug of grog?
Two mugs!
Your tea, Captain.
Earl Grey, hot.
Please, sir, may I have some more?
To our cunning captain.
Okay, you gotta love the boots.
Just one year ago, we'd lost everything.
Our ship turned adrift, and then we found her.
Exactly.
We needed a captain.
And when we humbly asked if she could make us fly... She didn't stop there.
No!
She did one better, she did.
Better indeed!
Soon, she's going to make the whole ship fly!
To flying!
Fly?
First the Tower of London, arr!
The guards won't know what hit it We'll swoop right down and take the crown And the Crown Jewels with it And when we fly to Paris Oh, the treasures I'll be grabbin' The Mona Lisa will look lovely Hanging in me cabin Hey-ho Imagine the places that we'll go No one can stop us When we're so High in the stratosphere!
Hey-ho We'll be the freighter that plunders Every one of the world's seven wonders When we're up in the skies For who can fight a frigate that flies?
No one can fight a frigate that flies Next we'll roam to Rome, me lads And here's what I'll be stealin' I'll rob the Sistine Chapel Of the Sistine Chapel's cieilin' And for all the folks in Egypt It will be a dismal day They'll be crying for their mummies When we take their mummies away!
Hey-ho Imagine the places that we'll go No can stop us when we're so high!
They will all cower in fear Hey-ho, from Delhi to Rio to Venice There's no city that we will not menace When we're up in the skies For who can fight a frigate that flies?
No one can fight a frigate that flies Oh, how high we will be!
We will be 'Cause the blue fairy dust Surely packs a mighty wallop Only takes a dollop Soon it will set us free We'll be free From the chains of gravity Then we'll hoist up the sail And we'll set course for the sun 'Cause when you've got wings No wicked deed cannot be done And we owe it all To our great and glorious captain Although, now that you mention it, why are we taking orders from some fairy, anyway?
Heh, heh, heh... Two, three, four!
Hey-ho, imagine the places that we'll go No one can stop us when we're so high Givin' a pirate cheer Arr!
Hey-ho, we'll be the freighter that plunders Every one of the world's seven wonders When we're up in the skies For who can fight a frigate that flies?
Hey-ho, there's not a town or a county That will not yield its bounty up When our ship draws near Hey-ho, there's not a city or village That we will not plunder or pillage When we're up in the skies For who can fight a frigate that flies?
And every nation will give a donation When they see us sail the skies In a frigate that flies!
Hey!
Ah!
Whoa.
Tink.
It looks like...
The Pixie Dust Tree back home.
Zarina must have grown it.
So, that's how they're going to fly.
She's going to make pixie dust.
Ahoy, you biscuit-eating bilge rats!
Prepare to dock starboard!
Docking starboard!
Captain says, raise the sails and step lively!
Raise the sails!
Heave!
Bring her around, Mr. Yang!
Bringing her around!
Let go anchor!
Let go anchor!
Get out all lines!
Get out all lines!
Casting lines!
Come on, get moving.
Are you talking to me?
Captain says, restock the ship.
We set sail at dawn.
Yes, Captain.
Load ship, right away.
Hey, watch where you're swinging that thing!
Work faster, now!
That's it!
Come on.
Locked.
Come on, you lubber, get on with it.
Someone's coming!
Pirate!
Hide!
Animal Fairy, you're up.
Excuse me, mouse.
Uh... Mr.
Mouse.
Would you mind terribly moving on?
We need this space to do a little hiding.
Oh!
Much obliged.
Bye-bye!
Aw, what a cute little mouse.
It was a rat.
Ew!
Hey, shoo, rat!
Uh, permission to enter, Captain.
This is our chance.
Now!
No!
I had Oppenheimer make you your favorite.
The dust.
I know how much you like a little something sweet while you work.
Well, you're quite welcome.
Hmm?
Oh, uh...
Uh, yes, of course.
Sorry.
Ah, right, second drawer.
Look at that.
It sparkles like a thousand sapphires.
You're quite the little genius.
It's hard to believe the other fairies didn't appreciate your talent.
Sil?
She looks seasick.
This never happened when I was a Water Fairy.
You know, I remember when I couldn't understand a single jingle.
Oh, no!
Huh?
I'm fine.
Fawn!
Sorry!
What are you doing?
What Dess does.
That's not what I do.
Well, stop it!
You shouldn't take light so lightly.
What?
What, what?
What?
No, nothing, nothing!
Ooh.
It's still so hard to believe that this blue dust can make flying dust.
Yes, but only if you... Ah!
So, the secret is the infusion of the blue dust directly into the tree.
You okay?
Start throwing out the line.
All right, Tink, open the drawer as much as you can.
So, once the golden dust has been produced... Sil, hold the line.
The sluice will coat the ship with the perfect amount, and at that point, we take to the skies!
Very impressive, Captain.
No pirate I know could have imagined such a scheme.
Whoa!
Ahh!
Oh.
Vidia!
You've turned out to be quite the pint-sized prodigy, if I may say.
It's been an adventure and an honor.
Your sword, Captain.
Hmm.
Y'all okay?
Yeah.
They're headed for the tree.
Come on!
Whoa!
What is up with your... Hey, hey, we should catch up with Tink.
Shh.
All right, just give me the strap.
That's it, hold it in place.
Right, watch the angle of the flume.
Too much pitch, and she'll overflow.
Aye aye, Captain!
Make sure the seams are sealed.
Captain doesn't want to lose a single grain of that precious dust.
Oh, that golden dust.
Dess!
Quiet!
Sorry.
I barely touched it.
Well, don't touch it at all.
Just hover.
Yeah, hover.
All right, all right.
As soon as she's gone, we'll grab the dust and get out of here.
Maybe we should try and talk to her.
Yeah, because that worked out so well back at the waterfall.
Hey, shoo.
Hey!
Shoo, shoo!
Hey, hey, hey... Go, go, go!
Oh, no.
No!
No, no, no, no, no!
Stop growing.
Stop growing.
Please, branch, no!
We 9011 you!
Did you really think by switching our talents, you could beat us?
Looks that way.
Got them!
Zarina!
Well done.
Got them all in one swell foop, I did.
Zarina, don't do this.
Come back with us.
Come back home.
I'll never go back to Pixie Hollow.
You don't belong here.
This is exactly where I belong, Tink.
We appreciate what she can do.
We treasure it, actually.
Put them below, and keep your eye on them.
Oh, right.
Maybe I'll use, uh, this one?
While you still have it.
Captain, are you all right?
Captain says, back to work, gentlemen.
All righty, mates, you heard him.
And, right.
Perfect fit.
Welcome to your new cabin.
Oh.
Me stock is ready.
Oh, well, now, look at that.
Oh, lovely.
Oh, that is good eating right there.
Isn't it, Mum?
"Yes, it is, darling."
Oh, let me see.
What shall I make tonight?
Well, I've still got some lard and some old cabbage.
Okay, we need a plan.
Here we go.
Whoa!
Mmm.
Ah!
Oh!
It worked!
Yes, she did it!
It worked!
it's working!
Pixie dust!
Look at it!
Amazing!
We're going to fly!
From a trickle to a roar.
Fly like a happy bird!
Cold gruel, with a little bit of sawdust.
A dash of rodent, sauteed of course.
Some carrots?
No.
Hey, where you think you're going, little fella?
Now is our chance.
Go, go, go, go!
Come on, all together.
I'm going as fast as I can!
Oh, not today, my darlings.
Would you be kind enough to hold this for me?
Perfect.
Anybody else got an idea?
Absolutely astonishing.
Just imagine, flying like a bird.
Of course, you do that all the time.
What's it like?
How do you even steer?
It's pretty simple, actually.
Lean left.
Lean right, fly right.
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
This is... Are you afraid?
Hmm?
Afraid?
Lead on, Captain.
Oh, I'm doing it.
I'm...
I'm flying!
Look out, mates!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Look at him go.
What's so funny?
Whoa!
Whoa, whoa... You can't fly like that.
Put your legs together.
Whoo!
Oh!
On.
Just try to keep up.
Whoo-hoo!
Whoo.
Ave ave, Captain!
The lad is flying!
It works!
It really works.
And pretty soon, we'll have enough dust to make the whole ship fly.
Right, Zarina?
And as long as we have the blue dust, we'll never run out of flying dust.
Right again?
Right again, James.
Well, then, we won't need you anymore.
Our plan worked perfectly.
Fairies are such gullible creatures.
Aren't they, lads?
No match for an Eton education such as mine.
He's a smart one, isn't he?
The power of the pixie dust is finally ours.
We've had enough kissing up to that pint-sized prima donna.
No quarter for her.
Let's make her walk a tiny little plank.
Yes, tiny!
A tiny plank!
She can fly, you cretins.
Oh!
You know, he's right.
That is why he is the captain.
She'd just fly away.
I get it.
Mi capitan.
What if we tie her wings together?
There's no stopping us.
We'll plunder every port in all the seven seas.
Prepare to get under way, you scurvy scallywags.
We've got a ship to fly.
Ha.
And as for you, you'll make a fine little nightlight.
Swoggle me eyes.
Now, there's a sight.
Oh, don't feel foolish.
I was just too clever for you.
That's all.
Ah!
Yes.
Now, you see, my little fairy, navigating the Never Seas is one thing.
But to chart a course for the sky, not only do you need longitude and latitude, but you also need altitude.
Hmm.
Oh... Now, let's not be a sore loser.
Once we're past the second star, the world will be my oyster.
And I don't even like oysters.
We'll be in and out of every port so fast, they won't even know what hit them.
No, no, no.
Nice try, but it's fairy-proof.
Brilliant, right?
Oppenheimer!
That ticking is driving me mad!
Right.
It's just a clock, you know.
Well, not to worry.
Pretty soon, we'll be flying so high it'll make these high seas look downright low!
Crazy.
Like we have a choice.
Come on, guys, we're gonna get out of this.
Well, we wouldn't even be in it if our new Garden Fairy didn't grow branches willy-nilly!
You're not saying this is my fault.
Hmm.
If the flower fits.
How can I cook with all that infernal jingle-jangling?
There's only one thing to do.
Oh, much better.
Don't you think, Mum?
None of it would've happened if you would have come over to help me with the bee!
Are you saying this is my fault?
Well, if the rose fits.
Let's not point fingers.
It's Zarina's fault.
Guys?
Guys?
Right, what about her?
Yeah, let's talk about that.
Guys, look!
Great.
Just what I need.
Uh-uh-uh.
Bad crocodile.
Bad croc.
I am not your mother!
Wait.
Rosetta, he can get us out of here.
You're right.
Good.
Good crocodile.
Come here.
Come here, stocky.
Come to Mama.
Shh!
Quiet.
Okay.
Now, pull us off the table.
Come here.
Come to Mama.
That's right, sugar.
What is going on here?
A stowaway, is it?
Oh, no!
Oh, no, you don't.
Hello.
Hurry!
Hurry!
Gotcha!
Rosetta!
A little extra flavor.
Ooh!
Good job, crocky.
You are such a good little boy.
Yes, you are.
What a good little widdle snuggle wuggums.
That's his mama.
Okay, enough.
Let's get out of here.
Wait, Vidia.
We can't just race out there.
They'll see us.
Hmm.
Make ready to sail!
Aye aye, Captain!
I love the life of a pirate.
But I hate rats.
Move it, Port.
I'll move it in me own good time.
Huh, see anything?
Nope.
All clear up here.
Well, it's not clear down here.
It stinks!
I know, isn't it great?
Smells just like skunk.
Huh.
Spoken like a true Animal Fairy.
I Wish.
All right, you guys.
Remember, right arm, left foot.
Got it?
Aye aye.
Sil, I'm right, you're left.
Right.
No, left.
I mean, left.
What?
And you're right.
Let's go.
AYE aye!
Big pole.
Back, back, back.
Forward, forward, forward.
Hey, you swabs, work faster!
Hey!
Oppenheimer!
Don't forget the kippers.
And you, back to work.
Ah, muy bien.
Ah, we're gonna fly, mate!
We're gonna fly!
It's a do-si-do.
I can't dance!
Uh-Oh.
Look out!
Fly!
Would you watch where I'm going?
Go, go!
Come on!
Hurry UP!
Okay.
We got it!
Return that blue dust!
Or your friend is done for.
That's right.
Captain Zarina has been relieved of duty.
Ha.
You truly are a talented fairy.
Prepare to cast off!
Weigh anchor and get ready to fly, me hearties!
Casting off!
It's working!
I can't believe my eye!
Weigh anchor!
We're flying!
We're flying!
It's perfect.
We can fly!
Oh, my!
Up, up and away!
Shiver me timbers, we're flying!
Bon voyage, little captain.
No!
Come on, hurry!
Hurry!
Help!
Please!
Help!
Help me!
Here, I'll dry you off.
We're flying!
Are you okay?
You saved me.
Why?
Let's just say, we're offering you quarter.
I'm so sorry.
They're headed for the second star.
If they make it past we'll never find them.
The blue dust will be gone forever.
Then let's stop them before they get there.
Captain.
Port, Starboard, get up the mizzen and raise the royal.
Aye aye, Captain!
Raising the royal!
More pixie dust!
Who's in the mood to plunder?
You guys turn the ship around.
I'm getting back that blue dust.
Right.
Look alive, men!
The second star, dead ahead.
Nothing but smooth sailing.
Huh?
Yeah!
Fairies!
Fairies!
It's the fairies!
She's back?
Well, get them off my ship.
Gladly.
It's actually quite amusing.
Stand your ground, men!
Yang, the helm!
Ave ave, Captain!
Ladies, until we meet again.
Great.
Ha.
You dare to fight the captain, do you?
Only until I get that dust.
Well, this should be fun.
Come here, you little cuties.
Okay, this isn't working.
Fawn, the spyglass!
Brilliant!
You tiny thing.
No!
Man overboard!
I did it!
Stop them, you imbeciles.
They're six-inch fairies!
Fawn, the wheel!
Sil, whirlwind!
Take that!
Whoa, whoa...
Blast it.
The second star!
They turned the ship around!
Yup, we sure did.
Get this ship back on course!
Aye aye, Captain!
Now!
Why you... Bull's-eye!
No fair!
Come back here!
Fairies, fairies, nothing but fairies!
Stop moving so fast.
Ha-ha!
Just one more, pirate.
Jingle-jingle.
Ha!
Uh-oh!
Nice work.
Just thinking like a Tinker.
No, no, no!
Take that, you little... Oh, my!
Avast, crocky!
Charge!
No!
Get it away, get it away, get it away, get it away!
Yeah, that's it.
Don't make me use my teaspoon.
Oh, no.
Oh, no, you don't, you little... Oh!
You ate my mummy's clock?
What was wrong with the spatula?
Sic him!
Oh!
That's my crocky.
There's nothing I revel quite as much as a worthy opponent.
You're stronger than you look.
Hey, need some help?
Anchor's away!
Grow some seaweed, sunflower.
Whoa!
Ahh!
Now, that's some seaweed!
I've had just about enough of this.
Ha!
You, too!
You're not going anywhere.
These ought to fetch a hefty price, eh?
Back on course.
Give me that dust!
No!
The dust!
Not my dust!
No!
I got the dust.
Oh, you're okay.
Oh, thank goodness.
Let's get you out of there.
Lean right, fly right.
I'll take that!
Now, where was I?
Ah, yes.
The second star.
You simply don't give up.
Well, I guess I'm stronger than I look.
The second star.
Oh... Zarina!
You fought well, little fairy.
But it's over.
The dust is mine.
The ship is mine.
Your adventure has come to an end.
Oh, go ahead, take it.
What's one speck between friends?
No, really, I think you should have it all!
Huh?
From a trickle to a roar.
Whoa!
We're free!
Look at him go!
He's very fast.
Yeah, you think?
Is it time to get that blue dust back?
Watch this.
Can't fly without dust.
Blast!
Goodbye, James.
Curse you, fairies!
Curse you!
Tiny she-devils they are, really.
Huh?
Oh, no, no, no!
I am not a codfish!
I'm a pirate!
All right.
You got the dust!
We did it!
We can go home!
Oh, I'm gonna soak in a nice, hot milkweed bath.
Get the smell of pirates off me.
That was what I was thinking.
You said it, Ro.
Here, please, take this back to Pixie Hollow.
Uh, Zarina, we didn't just come for the dust.
Oh!
Um, Ro?
There's something you should know.
It's about your hair.
First, I lose my talent, then I become a mother.
I do-si-doed in a stinky shoe, and now, my hair?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah Well, you don't know who you are Sky is the limit And I just wanna flow Free as a spirit on a journey of hope Hang on, guys!
Cut the strings and let me go I'm weightless, I'm weightless Millions of balloons tethered to the ground Hey!
There it is.
Home.
And... now!
Bobble!
You're awake!
This is the best show yet!
Uh, girls?
Queen Clarion, we got the blue dust back.
Which I didn't know was missing.
We also got Zarina.
Zarina!
Oh, you're home!
Yeah.
And from now on, I promise... You know, Zarina's pretty much mastered that pixie dust thing of hers.
Yeah, she even grew a pixie dust tree.
Now, we've got an extra.
Does this talent of yours have a name?

No one can fight a frigate that flies Next we'll roam to Rome, me lads And here's what I'll be stealin' I'll rob the Sistine Chapel Of the Sistine Chapel's cieilin' And for all the folks in Egypt It will be a dismal day They'll be crying for their mummies When we take their mummies away!

And every nation will give a donation When they see us sail the skies In a frigate that flies!
Hey!
Captain Red!
Capt...
The hook, the hook!
Was that you?
What?
I thought I heard...
It sounded like... a pig.
Must be the heat.
Now, now, Froggy?
Be reasonable.
Come on down, you little baboon.
You want to eat me.
Damn it.
It's a law of nature... by thunder!
The strong always eat the weak.
Come on down lad... make an effort.
Cannibal!
Come on, piggy-wiggy.
I'm not piggy, I'm the Frog.
Cannibalism is a mortal sin.
It will bring you bad luck!
You shall writhe in hellfire.
What about confession?
What do you think confession's for?
Sail ho!
Sail ho to windward!
Devil take you, Frog, have I not told you to trust me?
Am I not proved right again.
Aye, aye, Cap'n.
Well you're not to forget it, you little rascal.
Never lose faith in divine providence... never!
Watch out, lad!
The shark, a shark.
'Twas good sport, though, by thunder, 'twas indeed.
You can have me balls for breakfast if 'twasn't, what do you say?
Whatever you say, Cap'n.
Then we're both agreed.
Ah-hoy!
A-hoy there!
Dang me buttons!
There's a thin slice o' luck!
See her colors?
Spaniard!
Quick, quick...
The documents, for heaven's sake!
Me gold!
Miserable wretch!
God will be your ruin, Cap'n.
It will cost us our heads.
Easier to live without a head than... without gold, you numskull.
I fight for hatred or the Spaniard...
I fight for glory, not gold!
A man fights for what he lacks the most.
Shiver me soul!
What, Cap'n Red?
"What, Cap'n Red?
What, Cap'n Red?"
Can't you see those whore-sons ain't a-changin' course?
She'll run straight past us, all sail set and the wind up her tail.
Aye, Cap'n... she's holding course.
Per-perhaps... 'tis a ghost ship?
Ghost or no ghost, we need a- rescuing', by thunder.
Ahoy!
Ahoy there!
Ahoy on deck!
Here, Frog!
I'm stuck!
Drop the chest, Cap'n!
Drop the chest!
Never!
Three.
Four.
Five.
Six.
Quick, quick...
Pull.
Pull, damn it... Help!
Help!
Here... Me treasure!
Murder!
Five-and-twenty years of unstintin' toil!
All me savings!
Down to the brig with them!
Come over here, and open your lug-holes.
If they should question us remember this: henceforth, I'm Benjamin Parr... of London, understand?
I understand, Cap'n.
Cotton shipper for Matthew Spencer and Company, right?
Attacked at night by pirates.
On board the... "The Morning Star".
Sunk with all hands.
We're the sole survivors.
Repeat.
Benjamin Parr of London, cotton shipper of... Tobacco or vanilla would be better.
And who might you be, sir?
Joseph Seraphin Amadeus Boomako.
Boomako?
Boomako, ship's cook.
What the devil are you doin' down here?
I'm in irons, Captain.
And why's that, pray?
Spaniards loco... they say Boomako poison great Captain Linares to steal throne.
Throne?
What throne?
Throne of Kapatek-Anahuac.
Kapatek-Anahuac?
Here?
Who?
The throne.
Ah, here.
You've seen it?
Ah, by little hole.
Where, for God's sake?
Here.
Put your eye here and you see...
If I may make so bold, they'd look very well hanging from the yardarm.
Yet you have just informed me that they were victims of a shipwreck.
A pair of dogs, Your Honor!
An Englishman and a Frenchman!
Lieutenant, I would remind you once and for all, that the war is over.
On paper, perhaps.
When a treaty bears... the sign manual of His Most Catholic Majesty... personal sentiments must take second place to national obligations.
You Honor's vinegar purge.
Another!
'Tis the fourth today.
I assure you, doctor, I have naught left inside me to be purged of.
And Spain's present obligations are clearly defined by the Treaty... of Pyrenees...
It will get cold, Your Honor.
which treaty expresses the will of our noble King Philip the Fou... ourth... A treaty signed by His Excellency Cardinal Mazarin... to the greater glory of our country and the honor of our Holy Mother... the Church.
Tut, tut... we haven't eaten our oatmeal.
Quite possibly.
So we need look no further should Your Honor have no movement of the bowels.
Now then.
You were shipwrecked, I am told.
We were indeed, Your Honor, sir, till divine providence saw fit Deo gratias, to put us in the way of this here vessel belonging to the good King... of Spain.
I see.
This shipwreck... how did it come about?
Pirates... Devil take 'em!
Who were these pirates?
'Twere too dark to see, sir.
I did hear 'em shout a name, though... wait...
I think... Ah, I heard "Cap'n Red, what shall we do with 'em?"
"Kill 'em all," says he.
"There's naught but baccy and vanilla aboard this hulk. "
That was our cargo on the "MorningStar", sir, tobacco and vanilla.
You heard "Captain Red", are you sure?
Sure as I've a timber leg, sir.
He has been dead these past four years.
Garcia Gomez put an end to him... at Boca del Toro.
This dog must have been dreaming.
What ain't no dream, Your Honor, is all I possessed... went down in that there skirmish.
Homeward bound, I was... after 18 years a-workin' me fingers to the bone on a little vanilla plantation.
Life's always dealt me harsh.
Take this cursed leg o' mine; crushed by a barrel of vanilla at the tender age of three-and-twenty.
And the scar?
On your head... was that a barrel of vanilla too?
Not at all, sir, not at all.
That's from the irons they used to pluck me from me poor late mother's womb.
I 'hope Your Honor gaveno such trouble to his own mother.
Some respect, dog!
Away with them.
Look at it sing, the tasty little titbit!
Caramba, I could make you sing a song or two.
And you wouldn't need your guitarra, believe me!
Are you not, as I have had the pleasure of bein' told, the carpenter?
Master Carpenter.
And a fine trade it is, by the power!
Many's the time I've regretted... not learnin' it myself.
Still, too late now, and there's an end on it.
I perceived your kindly features at once, master carpenter, and was a... wonderin' whather pr'aps you might wishto devote a little of your precious... time to me timber leg.
What's amiss with it?
Cutt off short in its prime...
I drift to starboard every step I take.
These are some precious family heirlooms what I've always refused to... be parted from, even in times of direst adversity.
Like this one here.
'Twere given me by me favorite aunt.
And the other?
Ah, that one!
Me father gave that to me poor old mother, God rest her!
Thank you, gentlemen.
I think we have settled matters insofar as we are able.
Go take some rest and leave me to prepare for my own, which I warrant... this time will be a lasting one... Long live the King!
Long live Spain!
Long live the King!
Long live Spain!
I have done all I could, Your Honor.
I know, my good Juanito, I know.
Alas, there are times when all is not enough.
Farewell, Doctor.
My son, unburden your soul to Almighty God.
Confess your sins and repent of them is humility... that they may be forgiven you.
Ah, my sins... How they haunt me!
We both know, my son, how Satan con profit from a sailor's isolation... inciting him to shameful solitary practices.
I am an old man, Padre...
Very well, then.
There remain greed... anger, pride, mendacity, sloth... Let us wrestle with them one by one.
For some time now, I have been plagued by certain weighty questions which... hardly pertain to mendacity or sloth.
What manner of questions?
Throughout my life I gave fought for... my King, my country, and Holy Mother Church.
And God shall reward you for it.
I have killed in their name.
A soldier's duty.
Aye, but 'tis a sorry duty to kill... men, women and childrenfor the sake of a nation's gold.
These are savages... cannibals, some of them!
They don't even know the value of gold.
Value of gold!
Kapatek-Anahuac!
Is it God?
An eagle?
The sun or the moon?
The throne carries a curse if it is removed from its rightful place.
The other night...
I dreamed... it was red with blood...
If we were wisewe would hurl it overboard...
The Neptune might sit on it without fear or remorse... but we poor mortals... And my ship?
What will become of my men?
Why was I born a Spaniard and not an Aztec?
Why, Padre... are there never answers to the questions that truly matter?
Why?
Man that is born of woman hath but a short time to live and is full of misery.
He cometh up and is cut down like a flower.
We beseech Thee, o Lord... to receive into the depths of this ocean, upon which he sailed as... a brave captain and a valiant soldier, thy faithful servant... Don Jos Maria Alonso Ordonez de Linares y Escobar... Knight of the Order of the Holy Cross.
What a creature!
Proud as a peacock and twice as 'andsome.
Ah oui, and those eyes... they burn like coals of fire.
And that skin... smooth as peach, pardieu!
The Lieutenant, you dunderhead.
Guards, prepare to fire.
Fire!
Come and see this.
Come here and look at this.
Look, look at this.
We'll all die of the plague!
Get back in line, you dogs... in line, I say!
Yeah.
Hold, hold!
I'm not the cook, I'm his replacement!
I know nothing of this.
I drink to the new Master After God of His Majesty's good ship "Neptune".
Gentlemen, Don Alfonso Felipe Salamanca de la Torre.
Don Alfonso!
Your Honor, mutiny a board.
A what?
The men found a rat in the soup.
The wrecked is tearing 'em up.
Commander, turn up the guard.
We must fight for the betterment of our conditions.
We must claim... our rights.
All your rights... no exceptions.
We can beat them, if we stand together.
Right.
Unity is strength!
Right.
And the soldiers, what about them?
They are our brothers... We will talk to them.
They are sons of the people, like us.
Right.
The officers have bled us dry.
Jesus said... "'Tis easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle... than for an officer toenter the kingdom of heaven. "
The armory, lad... to the armory!
Must be somewhere close by here.
Ah, Corporal, we've come to mend a leak.
Leak?
Bosun's ordered is to help... the carpenter.
His mates is down with the squitters.
Must find this leak... 'Tis said to be close by the armory.
Ah there.
Vive la France!
The keys... see if he's got the keys!
No keys, Cap'n.
Out o' the gunport with 'im!
Holy Poker, that would've been too good to be true!
Here, Froggie, give us a hand.
I'm stuck.
Move a muscle and I'll blow your brains out.
Cut this quick!
Look alive!
These too!
Ship's company!
Your Captain will address you.
Now then, what seems to be amiss?
Come now, speak your minds!
There's naught to be afraid of... this is no galley ship.
Go on, go on, tell him... Well?
Go on, tell him what happened.
They... they... they're feeding us rats.
Rats?
A rat.
We want to relieve ourselves in peace.
We're sick of the whip... We want our rights... we want our rights.
Easy man, easy!
Don't all speak at once!
We shall settle this matter amicably.
You...!
You...!
You...!
And you two over there... the cripple and his crony.
Over here, all five of you!
The rest of you, back to your posts!
On the count of three...
I shall consider you mutineers and give the command to fire.
One!
Two!
Three!
Gentlemen!
It seems we have just been spared a mutiny occasioned by... this little rodent, which fell into the soup.
And what, pray, does our learned physician make of this?
'Tis boiled?
My late grandfather partook of several during the siege of... Cartagena, and never suffered any ill effects.
You heard that?
Aye, sir, we did.
"Never suffered any ill effects".
That is uncommon good news, you'll allow?
Aye, uncommon good, but...
But?
Come... would you represent our surgeon's grandfather to be a liar?
Nay, sir, I'd as soon slit me throat.
Then kindly be seated.
You are our guests.
I trust you enjoy your meal, gentlemen.
Could it be that you donot fancy Spanish rats?
Why, but we do, sir, we thinks gold dust of 'em.
Alas, we have but one.
I pray you, sir, one will be... more than suffice... you are too kind.
Some seasoning for our gourmets.
I fear we have no vanilla... Would you not prefer the head?
Nay, nay, lad, I wouldn't rob you of it.
To the last morsel, if you please.
For the love of heaven!
Don Alfonso!
You have demonstrated your dominion... over these wretches.
We have all understood.
Enough now!
Stop this cruel jest, I implore you, stop it at once!
Your desire is our command.
Get it off.
One!
Two!
Three!
That's it, then.
The whip for him, the rope for us.
Six!
Seven!
Eight!
Nine!
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou amongst... women and blessed is the fruit of... You might as well pray to a bowsprit.
Hey, hey!
No blasphemy, lade... not at this hour o' the watch.
I do not want to die like a dog.
I have a wife and babes.
I am still young, young!
O Jesus, in Thy infinite mercy.
They haven't the spunk of a weevil.
We must get ourselves out of this alone... just you Froggie, and myself.
I'm with you, Captain!
You're a bullycock.
I'm with you too!
And me, and me!
What's to be done?
Number one, stop gabbin'.
Number two, do as you're told.
Where's the dagger?
In my satch, sir.
Take it, Boomako.
Twenty seven!
That's it, that's it.
Cut our ropes, cook, but have a care... just beside the knot, and mind you leave a strand or two.
Having made their peacewith Almighty God... through the offices of Padre Don Antonio Fuentes, these four mutineers... are sentenced to be hanged by the neck until they are dead.
May the Lord have mercy on their souls.
Shipmates, you shall be avenged.
Shut up you.
You want the rope as well.
Do you want it?
Cause you can have it.
My son, unburden your soul to Almighty God.
At this supreme moment, you must confess your sins that they may be forgiven you.
Matter of fact, Padre, I'd be glad to 'ave the benefit of your theological... advice, just in case of accidents.
You never know.
Resign yourself, my son.
In a few moments you will be meeting your Maker.
Well, meantimes...
I should tell you that I had a mind to eat the Frog... and I'm a-feared bad luck may come of it.
God created animals to be eatenby man, so why not a frog?
Come, my son, what else besides?
Beggin' your pardon, Reverend... but that's the Frog, standing alongside.
'Twas 'im I had a notion to eat.
Now that is a serious matter.
Proceed!
Heave!
Fire!
Down with the officers!
For the love of Jesus, have pity on him... No... Have pity.
Frog... down to the armory, son!
Hurry!
Take some of the lads with you!
Hold them back, hold the door.
Put your weight behind it.
Take them on deck.
At your age... have you no shame?
Hands off the prisoners!
Easy now, hombre.
If there's enough... for one, there's enough for two.
Here's your shawl.
I beg you to pardon the hole, mam'selle.
Shipmates!
Divine Providence has seen fit to deliver... this here vessel from the tyranny of your de-generate Hidalgo masters.
I do hereby take possession of her in the name of brethren of the coast... and shall henceforth command her.
I am Captain Thomas Bartholomew Red!
Mercy, have pity... Long live Captain Red!
Long live Captain Red!
Long live Captain Red!
What are you babbling about, you bakehead?
'Ap'n... 'Ap'n...!
What captain?
Where's that water?
A ghost!
A ghost!
There, 'Ap'n!
What's the fuss?
Aye, 'tis Captain Red himself, flesh and blood... so don't stand there gaping.
Sooner go getch us a good bottle of Hollands... you can see the Captain's got a thirst on him.
Well, you old shark... got me 632 doubloons marked down in that vampire's account-book o' yourn?
Strange you should ask, Captain.
I was just casting an eye over your account... and indeed, you're right... aye, 'tis exactly the figure.
Though the whole 632 might be difficult to raise at the moment... prices have gone up since you've been away... but with a sacrifice...
I may manage, say, a hundred down and the balance over... let me se... three months?
Would that be acceptable?
Blood-sucker!
You're tremblin'.
Is it fever or fear?
Neither one.
I'm all a-tremble with pleasure at seeing you restored to life.
And your best affidavit to thatwould be my 632 doubloons.
See the course I lay?
But!
Great Heavens!
What's this, Captain?
You're short of a leg!
Oh, an active man like yourself... what a tragedy!
Belay that.
Me doubloons!
Hendrick, bring me over my casket, that I may count out 622 doubloons for... Now we can talk business.
What business?
You don't... You don't reckon.
I'd come back empty-handed, do you?
I've got me a galleon!
-Gold!
Ah, no gold, not at all.
'Ostages!
Not again!
I've had a skilful of 'em... they're swarming like maggots all over the island.
I swear I'll never touch another hostage.
You keep 'em!
There... six hundred... and thirty-two.
Go fetch the Frog.
Is that one back as well?
Tell 'im to bring the hostages.
No, no... no thank you, not here!
Move, or you'll lose your ears!
Harkee to this, Dutch... What?
I've got... the niece of the Governor of Maracaibo, and the... First Lieutenant of the "Neptune"!
First of third, who cares?
For over 2 years now I've been trying to ransom the best-known lawyer in Spain.
Nobody wants him, his wife, his children, the bar at Seville, not even for free!
Those halfwits did cut his tongue out.
Of course... a lawyer without a tongue!
No, Red, no.
I mean it.
What with the traveling expenses, the go-betweens... the overheads... a hostage isn't even worth his keep these days.
Neptune, Neptune... Let me see now, she was bound for Spain, was she not?
Aye... And you say there was no gold on board?
Come in, come in, me beauties, that I may present you to Dutch.
No, no!
I don't want to see them!
Look, here she is... niece to the...
Governor of Maracaibo.
He'll cough up 3,000 at least.
What's your name?
Three thousand!
Insolent scoundrel!
If you knew your business you'd know...
I'm worth ten times as much!
Take them away!
Get them out of here!
Drown them if you've a mind too.
I want nothing to do with 'em.
You son of a double-dyed whore from the reeking gutters o' Rotterdam!
A plague on your scurvy head... what's wrong with me 'ostages?
They're hostages... that's enough!
What's this here, then... horse-apples?
Right!
So how much for him... a hundred?
Not even.
Last July Carlos the... Portuguese negotiated an arch-bishop for only 325.
So a padre... you can imagine!
You might dump him in Shark's Cove... he's not worth the price of his sandals.
We'll speak of it later.
Our of your juice, vulture!
You're givin' a party!
Aye, m'hearties, 'tis I. I've lost a drumstick, true, but the rest's all Cap'n Red!
I'm half-seas over with joy at seein' your friendly physiognomies again.
Diddler... still alive and kickin'?
You old skulk, you!
Where's Meat-Hook!
Ah, there you be... sour-faced as ever.
Bibleback!
Not grown much straighter, have you?
So Moonhead... took me for Satan himself out there, did you?
Soiled your linen, did you?
Strike me blind, you've as muchto say as a shoal o' mackerel!
Look at me!
Four years and more on a poxy desert island... yet I can still crack a smile.
What ails you all?
Had your tongues pruned like that dago lawyer?
That's better, me hearties.
Let's make the rafters ring!
We'll drain the Dutchman's cellar... drinks are on the house.
Life's a bed o' roses!
Dang me buttons!
That were worse'n a Spanish broadside!
We thought you was killed at Boca del Toro.
Saint's blood, that's what I thought myself!
So did the Spaniards likewise... else we'd not be here now.
Shan't forget Boca del Toro for quite a while.
Never did more killing... in all my life... Did I, Frog?
Never Cap'n.
Why, you should've seen old Froggie here, screamin' "Vive la France!"
And layin' about him like a demon.
That was your day, son, was it not?
Well, 'tweren't mine.
Damnation... cannon ball tore one leg to shreds.
Hey, Scratch!
That rum... do we get it today or tomorrow?
Directly, Captain, directly.
Moonhead, surprise, fetch up another keg.
I wan' hear 'Ap'n Red!
Do as you're told, wretch!
All that remained of the Black Princess a few spars and suchlike... broke up on the reefs of that accursed island.
Four and a half years' scrimplin' on turtle-meat and coconuts... Aye, purgatory it was... not like the good ship "Neptune"... where these generous Spanish officers received us like princes.
Come, come!
Join our little party!
Now's your chance... you've earned it.
Shift yer arses!
Make room for the gen'le folk!
Free our guests' flippers, that they may drink me health!
'Avin' been so 'andsomely received at your table, sir...
I 'ope I may prevail upon you to accept me 'ospitality.
An officer of the Royal Fleet does not drink with pirates.
It takes all kinds to make a world, does it not, Padre?
It does indeed, my son, it does indeed.
As we hear from Dutch, an expert in these matters... you're not worth a bag o' nails.
So, pirate that I am, I find myself obliged to have your hanged from... the yardarm of your beloved "Neptune".
You'll be dancin' a jig on air... come day-break.
What say you to that?
Death means less to me than... dishonor!
Had you the courage, you would confront me sword in hand.
You will not deign to drink with us, yet you would taste our steel.
Well, I have it in mind to play a little game we never tire of... me mates and I, which I myself call Dead Man's Nag.
Legs a thoroughbred!
To the death, gentlemen.
And if any rider's feet touch the ground before he's skewered...
I'll have you hanged... prompt, riders and nags alike.
Do not be distressed, mam'selle, 'tis only a sport.
There, that's better!
I like that!
The winner's life shall be spared.
Cap'n Red gives his word on it.
Tell me, I was just wondering, the throne or Kapatek-Anahuac... Who?
Kapatek-Anahuac... Never 'eard of 'im.
Well, I gather...
I thought the "Neptune"...
I heard a rumor that... What rumor?
Nothing... Just idle gossip.
Nothing.
You've been blabbin' about me throne, you dog!
No, not a word, Captain, not a word!
Mum as a clam, I swear!
Get up!
Get up, get up!
Get up, get up.
Yah, uh...
Damn it!
Get up!
Get up!
And who might you be, sir?
It must be that lawyer the Dutchman spoke of.
Is it you, sir, whose tongue these dogs have cut out?
Heaven be praised!
Can you assist us?
Do you have a plan?
What does he mean?
He appears to be to be thirsty.
Thristy?
Ridiculous!
What is that to us?
He wants some rum.
In the name of His Majesty, I command you to help us... we need arms.
Give him some rum!
What!
Three more barrels?
Over my dead body... you tell him that.
I'd rather you told him yourself.
"Three barrels of rum are to be taken aboard the "Neptune".
May God help you. "
Good fortune!
All our hopes go with you, my son.
Quite so, quite so.
Give us a blessing.
Quick, quick!
Where are those barrels?
Come!
Come on, mates, that's it!
I took bets on who could drink fastest.
You mean the most!
Who cares how long it takes?
I was thinking: if we were to keep one of these three barrels... would there not still be two left?
What do you say?
Keep it how?
Roll it over the side.
It would sink.
Nay, it'll float... we can moor it to the anchor and pick it up later.
Now!
No, later!
Long live the King!
Thanks be to God, who in his infinite wisdom has put an end to this mutiny.
The buccaneer is dead.
So is his crony.
Here's a man of mettle... one who put loyalty before treason.
He suffered terribly inthe fray, poor soul... but his valor shall not go unrewarded.
How say you, Gonzalez?
Long live the King!
Long live the King!
Long live the King!
Long live the King!
Long live the King!
A roving, a roving Since roving's been my ruin I aim We'll go no more a roving With you fair maid Why do you always stare at me?
Captain Red commanded me... not to take my eyes off you.
You are very obedient.
I do my duty.
Is he perhaps frightened that I shall grow wings and fly away?
Perhaps.
And you, sir?
I, mam'selle?
Why did you come to my rescue?
Why did you kill one ofyour comrades for my sake?
Ahoy there, sonny!
Come over here by us!
Or take her into the bushes!
Ah!
Very good morning to you, Master Carpenter.
I was just a'wonderin' if you had any further need o' me ring?
Since I've been parted from it, 'tis as though I were missin' a finger.
Here it is.
As good as new.
To arms!
To arms!
To arms!
On your feet swine!
On your feet!
On your feet...!
Up, up... You too, get up... Get up.
Me throne.
Me throne!
Here, you cut-throats... you forgot your trademark!
Better luck in the next world!
What will they do with us?
Rest easy, my pigeon.
I saw you born and I shall see you married.
Your safety is precious... to these cut-throats.
Yet they are not all wicked men.
That Frenchman, for instance...
He seems different... Anaconda Bay... that's where we'll hide.
All quiet topside?
Aye, sir.
All shipshape and seaworthy.
Tide'll be up by eight bells.
Who goes there?
Password!
'Tis, Maria Dolores Eugenia del Alcade.
Seorita!
This Padre and his brave companions have delivered me from the pirates' clutches.
Conduct me to my uncle.
At once, Seorita...
I will call the Officer of the Watch.
My son...
I have a communication of paramount importance to impart to His Excellency.
Kindly convey us thither with the utmost discretion.
No one else may know ofme presence 'ere... so batten down yer 'atches!
Well?
Did you hear what the Padre said?
Directly, Seorita!
Your uncle will rejoiceto see you safe and sound.
We have all been praying for you, Seorita.
Hell's bells!
Permit me to rouse my poor uncle, else he may die of apoplexy.
Uncle Archibaldo!
'Tis I, Dolores!
Wake up... wake up, I bessech you!
Uncle Archibaldo!
That'll do!
On yer feet, Archie!
Oh forgive me, Lord!
San Antonio deliver me from all these demons!
'Tis Dolores, your niece!
Eh!
Are we all dead?
Where am I, Father?
I'm not your father, idiot!
I'm Cap'n Red!
Thomas Bartholomew Red!
Himself... but pressed for time.
Now bend your earto this: I've got your niece here... and I'll trade her for the throne of Kapatek-Anahuac.
What insolence!
That throne belongs to the Spanish Crown!
No longer, you old whale!
I want it!
At once!
Never!
Do you understand?
Never!
Go on, sonny!
Where, Cap'n?
Rape!
What are you waiting for?
I...
I can't.
'Tis an order!
I know Cap'n... yet... no!
Insubordination!
Boomako, stand in for this traitor!
Aye, Cap'n.
No, no, save me, sir, for pity's sake listen to your heart!
Surely, my virtue is worth a throne?
You agree then?
Never!
You shall see what stuff a Spanish Governor is made of!
Monster!
At least have the grace to kill me before you dishonor me!
Cap'n, can't you see?
He doesn't care two coppers for his niece!
Let's have his eye out!
No!
Aye, there's a pretty notion!
Let's take a peek at 'is brains!
Spare him, I beg you!
I will give you my jewels... all my jewels!
Have pity on him.
I implore you, for the sake of the mother that... bore you in her womb!
Oh, my gout!
My gout!
Get off, quick!
You're killing me!
Help!
Hel... " Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
In the name of the Holy Virgin, stop!
The throne!
Give him his throne!
Go fetch it... Captain, go, but don't touch my foot again.
By the Holy Eternal, don't touch my foot!
Out of yer crib!
Now be a good lad and do as you're told.
Else... Take your pen!
Here, set this down... "I Archibaldo... " I... Eh, what's your name?
Archibaldo Estban del Acalde.
"I Archibaldo... yes, yes, and the rest of it...
Governor of Maracaibo... " Knight of the Holy Sepulchre... Stow that!
Write: "... of Maracaibo... do hereby discharge First Lieutenant Don Alfonso de la Torre... of all responsibility for me throne... " No, no, no, for the conveyance of the throne of Kapatek-Anahuac to Spain. "
Enter!
Your Excellency!
My respects, seora.
Lieutenant, we are in a grave... predicament!
The pirates attack at dawn!
Let them come!
We shall be ready for them!
Calm yourself!
This blackmore contrived to escape from their lair... he knows their plans.
Speak up, my good man.
It, 'tis I, Lieutenant... 'tis Boomako!
What!
That black dog here?
That renegade?
I'll settle his score here and now!
Governor, Governor!
Protect me!
You shall die, mutineer!
I grant him pardon!
His rightful place is on the scaffold... garroted with the rest of them.
Don Alfonso!
Kindly bear in mind that...
I alone am responsible for the administration of justice.
As you say, Excellency.
But this reptile sough to poison... Captain Avila de Linares!
Not true!
I loved the Captain like my own mother!
Shut your mouth, murderer!
Restrain yourself, Lieutenant.
You are addressing a pardoned man.
He's the one!
He jealous!
He poison our good Captain!
It's possible.
Your pardon, Excellency?
I cannot hear you.
Was saying that this cursed gout makes me suffer the tortures of the damned!
A plague upon it!
But enough of my afflictions.
Time is against us, Don Alfonso.
Captain Red... that filthy ayeee...
I mean, that noted gentlemen of fortune... intends to board the "Neptune", at dawn and take delivery of his... That is, steal the throne of Kapatek-Anahuac.
I'll make mincemeat of him!
In the meantime, I have resolved... as follows: the throne will be taken into safekeeping... by two secret envoys of mine.
They will come bearing a letter which... will absolve you of all further responsibility.
That is all.
You may withdraw.
Very good, sir.
And the password?
Password?
Er, oh, let me see... Gout is gold".
old is gold.
So be it, Excellency.
Not too tight?
Nay, sir.
My apologies.
Can you count?
Count what, Captain?
Count: one, two, three, four... Five, six, seven, eight, nine... That'll do, that'll do... perfect.
You're to count to ten thousand.
One, two, three... Not yet... as soon as we leave.
When you reach ten thousand... you're to join us aboard the brig at Anaconda Bay.
Understand?
Aye, aye, Captain.
Here!
No one us to leave this room alive before ten thousand.
Not even you.
Not even me, Captain.
Wish I 'ad more trumps like you under me command!
Who goes there?
Gout is gold.
An order is an order... so be it.
Lower away!
Lower away!
Triple the guard!
All hands to remains at their posts!
Aye, ayes, sir.
Stroke.
Stroke.
Stroke.
Stroke.
Hold!
Oh, O Lord, get Boomako out of this!
Don't let him sink!
Man ahoy!
Down on the beach!
Right now, here you are, Seorita.
And now, since, since my, my neck... is at stake and I have eleven mouths to fe... feed.
And this?
It is my bounden duty to search all... Rum?
Oh no, no, I could never turn a blind eye to that!
I come to bid you farewell.
And to thank you... Farewell?
Fate wished us enemies... yet you have twice saved my honor.
You are leaving?
This every evening I sail for Spain.
Pardieu!
This evening!
And... And?
My uncle has... Don Alfonso has been promoted Captain of the "Neptune".
I'm so unhappy Monsieur Malfiltre.
Call me Jean-Baptiste.
There is more: my uncle has betrothed me to Don Alfonso!
Against my will!
What do you have in your little basket?
My little angel!
God bless your kindly heart!
I, I have not yet told you the worst tidings at all.
Tomorrow, at dawn... You are both to be... garroted.
What about the throne?
Captain... You are to be...
Tomorrow, at dawn...
I 'eard yer, but where's the throne?
We don't give a damn for your throne!
He don't truly mean it... he's just shook up.
The throne is back on the "Neptune".
Captain, the Lord teaches us forgiveness.
I shall pray for your soul.
Farewell, Jean-Baptiste.
Hell's bells!
Blasted chain!
No sweeter voice could complement a sunset of such breath-taking splendor.
Thank you, Captain.
To be Master of as fine a vessel as this would gladden the heart of any man alive.
I am sure of it.
Yet for me 'tis not enough.
I mean to wait until such time as you may deign to appreciate my qualifies... and so... may come to love me.
Goodnight, Dolores.
Goodnight, sir.
Go on, dance!
Dance, dance!
Fire at will!
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
We're Christians!
By all that's holy, cease fire!
'Tis Friar Don Antonio Fuentes of the Dominican Order!
Madre de Dio... Aah!
There, there... where my finger is!
That little speck?
Yes, my lad.
That little speckis a brig.
I hope 'tis not a pirate, Captain.
Have no fear of pirates, seora.
They would receive a warm welcome... the "Neptune" carries 70 cannon.
She's the fastest galleon in the Royal Fleet.
The fatest?
Yes, sir.
Take that craft there.
A brig... every stitch of canvas out, yet... she hasn't gained a cable's length on us since dawn.
Why should she follow us?
She is not following us... she is merely sailing in the same direction.
Now!
That's just to put some fire in your bellies!
No goin' back now.
'Tis victory or death!
To board!
Into the longboat with you!
Take some vittles!
Secret mission!
Come, girl.
Come on, put your backs in it.
That's it, lower... What do you want to do?
Have some music?
Oh my God!
Stop you sobbing stupid woman!
Over the side!
Dolores!
Boomako... Boomako!
No, not up, down... Help!
Over here... Frog... Frog...!
Thanks you alive.
Hey!...
Hey!...
The rope, Frog, the rope!
Quick!
Cut it!
Merde!
'Tis an order!
You signed articles!
Cut it or I'll have you hanged!
Hold on!
Wait!
Wait!
Right.
Wait, wait, you lily-livered scoundrel!
Come back and fight... like a man!
Canaille... Fripouille... Cornegidouille...!
Alfonso, you scum!
I'll hunt you down...
I'll skin you alive!
e's an end to you once and for all, you slimy French Jean-Baptiste!
Aah, Captain!
Boomako is dead!
Come back!
Come back!
May you rot in hell!
Hey, Frog... What o'clock is it?
Six or eight... Good.
Give us an 'am and a bottle of Malaga.
Don't pull that face, damn you!
Drink!
Eat!
We're alive, aren't we?
And Frog?
Yes, Cap'n.
Would you do me a kindness?
Sing a little, while I nod off... and mind you sing, don't bray like a donkey.
Sing that little French ditty I've a liking for.
Il tait un petit navire Il tait un petit navire Dessus la mer, la malon lonre Dessus la mer s'en est all Pour achever le tour du monde Pour achever le tour du monde Sans jamais la malon lon la San jamais la terre aborder
PIRATES Oh God, Isabella I can not begin to tell you how happy I am right now Life is absolute perfection my love.
I must admit, Manuel, I'm nervous.
Life is absolute perfection my love.
I must admit, Manuel, I'm nervous.
Nervous?
There's no need to be nervous.
Is it true that the Caribbean Sea is full of pirates?
Yes, but would not let a pirate in sight or sound of your breath.
You are far too sexy I can not wait to see your body Oh, stop it , we're married now.
You'll see it soon enough.
But there is something What if you see my body, you decide you do not like it?
Then I must sell you to a pirate as a sex slave.
You're worth a gold piece or two.
Manuel, you're such an ass.
What?
"Seriously You're my wife now and forever, nothing will change that I love you for all you are Everything you're not and all that will be Thank you my love Thank God.
Heavenly Perfection!
I've waited for 260 years this magnificent moment We are close and she has given no sign that we have been seen.
Well done.
Keep us sailing swiftly.
Aye Captain Well done.
Keep us sailing swiftly.
Aye Captain What's wrong?
Nothing ... return to sleep my love.
Where are you going sweet heart?
I'll breathe the sea air, and I'll return soon.
"Manuel, have you ever seen a night so divine?
In all my years at sea I've never seen such serenity God has blessed us with peace tonight Definitely has.
How long before we get to Caribbean waters?
Late morning.
That soon?
If we don't lose the calm breeze, and if it picks up ... ... we may arrive before sunup.
I'll get you there safely.. No doubt you have always sailed with speed and care.
Thanks friend Be gone.
You should be resting with your beautiful wife.
she's probably cold without you You're right captain.
Good night How is the sea air?
The only air I want is breathing your sweet breath.
I love you so much.
And I you.
When I have my tradepost, I'll give you everything you want.
I only desire you.
I know.
I just thought I'd sweeten the deal.
You're such a fool I'm a fool for you Line up the crew and bring the passengers.
And Sarina ...
Although I love you so, do not consider killing anyone this time What are you doing?
If you let her go, I'll gladly do what you wish.
What are you doing?
If you let her go, I'll gladly do what you wish.
There is no need for this violence!
Sorry sir.
There is no need for this violence!
Sorry sir.
Ahoy me hartees, my name is Captain Victor Stagnetti I apologize for any inconvenience ...that we"ve caused, but ....we are pirates I apologize for any inconvenience ...that we"ve caused, but ....we are pirates Sadly this is our way.
Usually this would end with people like you decapitated with your heads for the sharks, but this Usually this would end with people like you decapitated with your heads for the sharks, but this This sort of pirate delight does not have to occur if I get what I want.
What is it that you desire, Captain?
I was getting to that!
I hate when I'm interrupted don't you?
I was getting to that!
I hate when I'm interrupted don't you?
Aye!
Now.
I've been looking for a man for a very, very long time.
My search ends here and now The man with the name Manuel Valenzuela, step forward.
What a pretty pearl necklace That's enough!
I'm Manuel Valenzuela "Please, let me save her!
Good, I thought I would have to ... Good!
"Please, let me save her!
Good, I thought I would have to ... "Please, let me save her!
Good, I thought I would have to ...
I thought I'd have to throw the entire crew off the ship to find you.
"Please, let me save her!
Good, I thought I would have to ...
I thought I'd have to throw the entire crew off the ship to find you.
Captain, please, let me save her.
No!
You're too valuable for shark meat.
That is the fate of your beautiful lady.
No!
You're too valuable for shark meat.
That is the fate of your beautiful lady.
You'll stay by me for safety sake.
She is my wife!
Don't let her die.
I beg you, please ... Have compassion.
"Thank you gentlemen for your time You may go on your merry way, seamen.
I bid you adieu.
Back to the Devil's Rose.
And my vicious lady, too.
Helmsman, prepare to set sail.
Are you really going to let them go?
Of course not.
Sink her.
Captain's Log, August 25, 1763 It has been four long weeks since we've seen corsairs.
The crew has grown restless and unmotivated.
I try to motivate and teach them how to fight ...
They grow tired after little practice.
Somehow, my first mate, Jules... ...has managed to keep their spirits high.
Not sure how she does it.
Many of the men are inarticulate...
I think she gives them lessons to improve their oral skills or even Bible study.
Each night I hear the sounds of praise and joy from her cabin... ... that can only be induced by earnest worship.
At least we know that the good Lord will be with us ...
But there are more serious problems approaching.
Food supplements are quite low...
I fear we have to return to port soon.
I deeply desire to vanquish pirates we come upon.. but to be honest I am concerned.
Because Woo Chou cannot make the cannons fire.
Each time the cannon fired it smells like rotting goat's ass.
Woo believes that the powder needs more potassium nitrate and less sulfur.
It's not my fault!
The bad news is that we do not have potassium nitrate But regardless we will fight the pirates by sword or by hand ... ... To the death if necessary.
As for myself, I feel confident knowing that soon we'll sight a corsair ... ... when called upon my crew will jump into action.
We are men and women of the cold sea.
Pirates will fear us.
Captain Edward Reynolds.
Captain of the Sea Stallion.
Edward.
Excuse me the captain... ...has made specific orders not to be interrupted.
Unless we're under attack.
That's quite alright, Oxford.
I'll speak to the commander.
But sir it's quite necessary to complete the log... You are dismissed.
We'll complete the log later.
I suggest you report immediately to the crow's nest.
Aye.
Aye, Captain "Oxford was right, you should not have disturbed me."
As captain, it is my responsibility to make sure that all the ships protocols ... ...
Followed exactly.
As captain, it is my responsibility to make sure that all the ships protocols ... ...
Followed exactly.
As ship's captain I must make sure my orders are followed exactly... As captain it is my responsibility... ...to make sure the rules are respected."
"Edward, stop the charade."
What's wrong?
I'm a fool.
A lousy commander.
I can't hunt pirates.
I can't even hunt tuna.
The crew hates me."
"What are you talking about?"
We've been dreaming of this since we were children.
I'm a lousy commander we haven"t seen a pirate ship in four weeks.
Four weeks!
My father was right.
I should have stayed on the plantation ... ...helping run it.
-No.
You've just lost faith in yourself.
Yes, it's true.
You've never set foot on a boat before.
...
Yes its true.
You've never been in combat with a man nor pirate.
Its true you have no knowledge of the seas ... ...
But, you have a dream But that is stronger than any knowledge or experience.
It's your fate.
What if this is not my destiny?
What if this is not my fate?
You can "what if" your whole life and die peacefully in a warm bed or you can make worthy your existence... You can "what if" your whole life and die peacefully in a warm bed or you can make worthy your existence... ... and prevent pirates from inflicting suffering.
Well, let's see what our fate has in store for us Where's the Gallion, Oxford?
Off the bow my captain.
I don't see anything.
Look!
There's something floating in the water.
I don't see anything.
Check your dead lights, Oxford.
There is somebody floating on the wood.
Man overboard.
Helmsman, bring the ship around."
"Aye Captain.
Coming about."
Help me get her inside.
Okay, you're safe here.
Is she alright?"
Yes, just a little disoriented.
Here my dear.
Drink this, it will help you relax.
My name is Captain Edward Reynolds ... and you're safely aboard my ship, the Sea Stallion."
"Are you pirates?"
"Pirates, no.
We are pirate hunters.
Thank God, I thought I would die.
"You're safe here."
"That's what Manuel said too."
Who is Manuel?
My husband.
Was your ship attacked by pirates?"
Yes.
We were married in Spain.
We were destined to the Sevilla island.
"He was my family.
I'm sorry.
"We were awakened by pirates."
Then the pirate captain told my husband to step forward.
to reveal himself, but Manuel didn"t. ...then I was thrown overboard.
Do you remember his name?
"I think I said his name was Captain Victus."
"Stagnetti" Who is he?
He is the personification of all that's evil.
We must find him.
"He could be halfway across the ocean now."
Jules: Nevertheless, we must find him.
But first, we need more supplies and information.
We must go to Sorscabra Island.
But first, we need more supplies and information.
We must go to Sorscabra Island.
Where?
It is a small island along the coast, which harbors thieves ... ... Murderers and pirates of the Caribbean.
Edward:"I must talk to you about something."
Jules: Captain can we speak in private?"
"Isabella, I want you to sleep and rest assured... ... Knowing that you're safe here in my ship.
Do you think Manuel is alive?
"I don't know, but if he is, we will find him."
"Thank you."
Jules: "What has happened to you?
I just want us to consider the danger.
Can't we start with a pirate a little less... accomplished?
If we defeat Victor Stagnatt, we'll strike fear in all pirates.
Jules:"Think what the world would write."
Really?
What would they say?
Newspapers would say Captain Edward Reynolds saves the world from pirates.
Is it possible?
"Oh yeah, it's possible" Really?
Books would write about how handsome you are...
Yes, I do look good.
Don't I?
They would write about your bravery.
Yes, I do look death right in the eye and kick him... And read about the love you have for all creatures.
Right on the mark.
I love so much sometimes it hurts.
And read about the love you have for all creatures.
Right on the mark.
I love so much sometimes it hurts.
"Oh, Edward, the women!?"
What?...the women.
They will run into your arms for safety and comfort "I do have strong arms, don't I?"
Evil has no chance against these twin hellfire cannons.
Are you with me my friend?
Yes, now and forever.
Captain Reynolds, Pirate Hunter!
Faithful crew of the Sea Stallion...
I'm about to lead you on a perilous journey.
Faithful crew of the Sea Stallion...
I'm about to lead you on a perilous journey.
...into the eye of danger.
A journey in which some of you may never return.
We will hunt and kill the most notorious of all pirates.
Captain Victor Stagnetti and his ship, The Devil's Rose.
I have spoken with you about the dangers we'll find.
But this is a menace like none other.
Woo, Oxford, I will not blame if you do not follow me.
You are my friends now and forever.
Those who want to join me to take a giant step forward.
Remember that you will be well rewarded by my husband ... Well done!
Commander, set sail for Sorscabra island.
"Aye, Sir."
-Crew, smartly to the rigging!
Aye Captain!
Well said, Captain.
Thank you Commander.
What are we doing?
sailing for now.
But when the time comes, do what is necessary.
Crew, full speed ahead to Sorscabra Island!
I can feel its power beckoning me.
We are close Sarina.
Go into town.
Find the Indian and report back to me.
"As you wish."
There it is.
The brethren of liars, thieves, and murderers.
Sorscabra Island.
Helmsman lead us to the northern end of the island.
Seek a good place to weigh anchor.
"Aye captain."
Commander, tell the crew to throw the anchor.
Aye, Captain.
Crewman, prepare to drop anchor and disembark!
I'm not ready for this Jules.
I know.
Isn't that exciting!
Captain, Are we there yet?
Almost, Woo.
We're about ready to anchor.
Well then I can buy potassium.
Alright, now listen up.... Jules is looking west and south.
I will go to the north and east side.
Where shall I go, Captain?
Woo, you'll search everywhere between.
Will let you know if we find something.
"Aye Captain."
Isabella:"Can I help?"
"Aye Captain."
Isabella:"Can I help?"
Edward: "Yes, go with Woo."
Alright.
We have to remain vigilant.
We're about to disembark into the tongue of the serpant.
I'm looking for an Inca Indian living on this island.
Can anyone tell me where he is?
Well if it isn't the infamaous Sarina.
The villain, Sarina.
The murderous, Sarina.
If you don't know where the Indian is, I suggest you crawl back into the bottle.
I don't want to harm you.
I know where the Indian lives.
So tell me.
So close to death, and still no answer?
I'll tell you, but it will cost you.
The Indian lives across the island.
I believe he's a monk If what you said is a lie... you will die a long torturous death.
I do not expect anything less of you, Sarina.
I don't fear death.
I invite him here nightly to drink with me... but he always seems to stand me up.
I hope that death will find you soon.
I hope so too.
"Alms for the poor?"
Edward: "Right."
May God bless you.
"Look at his pretty dress."
Wore it for just you two sweethearts.
Step right up to the Gallion, my friends.
who offers me 4 doubloons for her?
Step right up to the Gallion, my friends.
who offers me 4 doubloons for her?
"Alms for the poor?"
Edward: "Wait a minute, didn't I just give you ... Alms for the poor?
Edward: "Wait a minute, didn't I just give you ... Alms for the poor?
"Here you go."
"May God bless you, Sir."
Heaven is expensive, if I get there.
"With a body like that...I don't think you'll have a problem."
"Thank you, ladies."
Run along monk-ey.
Look at you, aren't you a handsome boy.
And strong too.
Careful those cannons might go off.
You are so adorable.
The name is Edwards.
And yours?
I'm Madelin, nice to meet you.
This is Cristina.
Edward:"Cristina".
She's the newest addition to Pink Cannonball.
I'm Madelin, nice to meet you.
This is Cristina.
Edward:"Cristina".
She's the newest addition to Pink Cannonball.
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you too.
So tell me, what is Pink Cannonball?
"Come and we'll show you."
Sorry, I'm afraid I can't.
I'm looking for someone.
We can help you look.
We know everyone on the island.
Sorry, I'm afraid I can't.
I'm looking for someone.
We can help you look.
We know everyone on the island.
I'm looking for a pirate.
"We know many many pirates."
Don't we Madeline?
Of course we do.
But it's not safe to talk about pirates on the street.
Let's go inside.
I shouldn't.
"Come in and we'll tell you of all the pirates."
Hello, Marco.
Jules.
I knew one day you'd walk through those doors back into my life.
Marco, I'm not here to hurt you.
Oh, then I guess you're here to pick up the broken pieces of my heart.
...and the scrapbook of my suffering.
Oh, then I guess you're here to pick up the broken pieces of my heart.
...and the scrapbook of my suffering.
I do not know why I'm here, my ship came here.
Are you still captain of HMS Dingy Whore?"
Jules:"Why are you doing this?"
I'm sorry, did I invite you to sit for a drink?
-No.
And I saw you and I thought...
I'm sorry, did I invite you to sit for a drink?
-No.
And I saw you and I thought... You thought that I would invite chaos into my life?
Jules:"This will not work."
You know my life doesn't work ... since you left me, nothing works.
Stop your false tragedy.
Marco: Stop?
Stop?
Did my eyes stop crying when you left me?
Did my stomach stop aching with the loss of your touch?
Did my pain ever stop?
No.
No Jules.
It never did so, why should I stop now?
What do you want me to say?
I'm a slut.
I'm a whore.
I'm a streetwalker.
That I fuck every guy I encounter and I love it?
It's not true.
She's just making a point, you idiots!
Let's put things into perspective.
We had a few nights of decent of sex, don't be so dramatic.
Decent?
I was magnificent!
We had a few nights of decent of sex, don't be so dramatic.
Decent?
I was magnificent!
Yes.
You were amazing.
You were magnificent.
Then why did you leave me?
Yes.
You were amazing.
You were magnificent.
Then why did you leave me?
I made a mistake.
I severely regret it.
Yes, I left you for another, but I didn't mean to hurt you.
Hurt me, no.
You killed me!
Yes, I left you for another, but I didn't mean to hurt you.
Hurt me, no.
You killed me!
I walk this world without life without love, because of you.
Hurt me, no.
You killed me!
I walk this world without life without love, because of you.
Okay Marcos I'll leave you in peace.
You know what, even if you did leave me in peace, I wouldn't find it.
I'm in pain with you here, in pain when you leave.
Please let me be in pain, watching your beautiful face.
Sit down and have a drink.
Can we live in this moment...this moment alone?
Yes.
Time begins and ends here.
Yes.
Time begins and ends here.
I will drink to that.
Drink up sweetheart, live for tonight.
The past is but dust... And the future is but a mist in the coming winds.
Drink up.
Tonight will be a loving memory.
Father, forgive me, but I have sinned.
What are your sins, my son?
Why is this man tied up and gagged?
"He's not your concern."
Why is this man tied up and gagged?
"He's not your concern."
Any man suffering in the house of God is my concern.
I'm looking for a Inca Indians living and working in these walls?
I can not help.
Victor:"Let me warn you before you speak.
If you try to lie, I'll run this sword in your skull.
Who you are and what the devill are you doing here?
Don't speak the devil's name in vain.
Why would you cause another man to harm?
Because I can.
Surrender to God and your soul will be saved.
All you men of the cloth are the same.
Always wanting to save souls.
I'll ask one more time.
Then I'll cause so much pain that your soul will feel it in heaven.
I do not fear you or death.
Good.. Sarina tie the father to the altar.
I think it's time he confesses his sins... ...to Father Victor Stagnetti.
You are Captain Victor Stagnetti?
God help us all.
Save the worry for yourself.
It's a bit slow tonight.
-Cristina, why not get Edward rum?
No I shouldn't.
Nonsense.
A little grog won't hurt you.
Besides, you look tense.
You know, I've been under pressure lately.
Here you go my dear.
Thank you.
Ladies.
Good stuff.
I'll get you another.
Edward:"Okay."
Let's rest that gorgeous body.
Ladies, I'm looking for a pirate.
A pirate by the name ...
This fabric is so soft, what is it?
Silk from India.
So smooth.
Not as smooth as these silk lips.
here.
Touch it.
Yes, that's very smooth.
Thank you.
There's more delights where that came from.
Kissing with their tongue.
Nevermind.
He's ours, bitch.
Ladies, ladies, ladies ... ...
Please.
There will be no fights, not when Captain... Edward Reynolds is here to save the day.
There will be no bloodshit...shed...bloodshed.
What was I talking about?
You were saying you wanted to take us to Cristina and I to a bedroom.
Was I?
I don't remember that.
Yes, let's talk about this in a more comfortable place.
Do not even think to follow us.
The pirate's name I'm looking for is a... is a ... Let's talk about this pirate later.
Yes, let's talk about dreams and fantasies.
What do you mean?
Every man has a dream.
I dreamed the other night... ...that my cock was a giant Spanish gallion.
I dreamed the other night... ...that my cock was a giant Spanish gallion.
-No.
What have you always dreamed to be?
I want to be the greatest pirate hunter the world has ever known.
Your wish is our command.
Close your eyes and imagine that the bed is your warship.
You're floating on a sea of treachery.
It is night.
... and you are sleeping.
A pirate hunter's eyes are always open, always awake, vigilant.
Ready to do battle at a moments notice.
-Details.
These men always have many details.
Through the darkness, through the blinding snow, through the fog... -Details.
These men always have many details.
Through the darkness, through the blinding snow, through the fog... ...a pirate hunter will relentlessly hunt prey.
Nothing will stop him and nothing will stop me.
Pirates, attack.
It's time to taste sweet wine pirate.
Do you have wine?
Oh.
His sword is so massive.
Taste his sword.
Show him we do not fear his weapon.
Aye, Captain.
I'm the greatest pirate hunter in the world.
You're the greatest pirate hunter in the world!
I am the greatest pirate hunter in the world.
That was amazing.
Thank you.
A night to remember.
Great sex, drinking and meeting the world's most feared pirate... Who would that be?
Captain Victor Stagnetti's first mate, Sarina.
You met Victor Stagnetti?
Captain Victor Stagnetti's first mate, Sarina.
You met Victor Stagnetti?
No I met his first mate.
We traded wits.
She almost killed me.
You met Victor Stagnetti?
No I met his first mate.
We traded wits.
She almost killed me.
What's she doing here?
I don't know.
She was looking for some Indian... Did she say where she was going?
No.
Why do you care?
I'm just curious about pirates.
-Jules, I love you.
What?
I love you.
Okay.
Well?
What do you want me to say?
Nothing.
Nothing.
Nothing?
It must be something, Marco.
Would it kill you to say you love me too?
What happened to "yesterday is dust & tomorrow's mist"?
Well tomorrow is here and it doesn't love me very much.
What happened to "yesterday is dust & tomorrow's mist"?
Well tomorrow is here and it doesn't love me very much.
Marco.
"You know what Jules, just go."
"Go be a whore somewhere else."
That's it!
Wait.
What are you doing?
I tried to enjoy this night with you.
And it's clear that's not going to happen.
-Jules, please don't go.
Don't say a word!
OK, I overreacted.
Maybe I was too dramatic.
Don't say a word!
OK, I overreacted.
Maybe I was too dramatic.
My mother always thought it would be a great actor.
So make-believe I'm staying, so you won't be lonely.
No Jules!
Where are you going?
I can't lose you again.
Where you going?
No!
Jules!
I can't go through this again.
Why did you leave me filthy whore?
I love you!
I feel like I could die!
Ladies, that was exquisite.
The pleasure was all ours.
Here's your coffee, darling.
Thank you my dear.
Go away!
He's done.
I must say, I'm a little nervous in your presence.
Cristina and Madelin told me that you're a Pirates hunter.
I always wanted to meet a real pirate hunter.
I'm just a man... a great man....but just a man.
You look so strong.
-No pirate can withstand your brute force.
It's not my mighty sinew that's defeated so many pirates.
It's my knowledge of the sea which has guided me so gleefully.
You're not only beautiful, but your words are poetry!
It is not easy to be so smart.
Sometimes people don't understand what I'm saying.
Captain Victor Stagnetti could not stand your superior wit.
So you've heard of Captain Victor Stagnetti?
Yes, of course.
Everyone has.
He is in town as we speak.
Victor?
Here?
Where?
A few of his men had just left for Black Broom.
Black broom, where is that?
A few of his men had just left for Black Broom.
Black broom, where is that?
-2 Blocks to the left What will you do there? "
What I was born to do.
Hunt and kill pirates.
You're so noble.
Kiss me.
I must depart.
I'll go with you.
We'll fight Victor together.
No, this is something I must do alone.
No, please.
I can't stand the smell of here anymore.
I can take away the stench of the pirates from my body.
No, please.
I can't stand the smell of here anymore.
I can take away the stench of the pirates from my body.
Please.
take me with you.
I must go.
But when I return, I will ensure that those nasty pirates never touch you again.
Edward, I love you.
I must go.
No, I need you.
-Cristina, help me.
Come on girl, let it go.
You've got work to do.
-Cristina, help me.
Come on girl, let it go.
You've got work to do.
No.
I never want to work here again.
I found my true love.
Let go of me you bitches!
No.
I never want to work here again.
I found my true love.
Let go of me you bitches!
I'll be with you soon, my love.
Your pain tolerance is remarkable.
Why do not you tell me where the Indian lives?
I won't hurt him.
I made a promise.
Victor:"It's a matter of time, I'll find him."
Why are you doing this to me?
Because it's so wrong ...that's what makes it so pleasurable.
Sarina, wipe the blood from his lips I want to hear his suffering clearly.
My child, give up this wretched path.
God will help you.
It's too late.
Let God be the judge of this.
I'm glad you mentioned that.
Leave him alone.
Good timing ...
...I didn't want you to miss this.
NO!.
Why did you do that?
Sorry, old friend.
You've run around the world to escape me.
See what horror you've caused this man.
I have the descendant & the knife.
It is your duty to show me what I want to see.
I have the descendant & the knife.
It is your duty to show me what I want to see.
Follow me.
Sarina, hide the priest's body.
Keep Watch.
When I was little I wanted to be a sorcerer.
A sorcerer!
Why/ Why not a sorcerer?
What about that one?
Aye.
The captain will certainly be satisfied with her.
My mother taught me how to make black powder.
Someday I'll be a sorcerer, and maybe I will see my father again.
How about you?
What will you be?
Isabela, Isabela, where are you?
Where is the dagger of Atahualpa?
If you fail, you will drown in the blood of the innocent.
If he is not the true descendant he will die.
And we'll all drown in the blood of the innocent.
Proceed.
There you are.
Is he still alive?
Aye.
"Good."
Untie him and gather the stones.
Stop.
I know you're not a father, but I must confess to someone.
Follow me, my child.
Tell me your sins.
I have killed many men.
Say 7 Hail Mary's and 10 Our Father's.
"That's not all.
"Proceed.
I had premarital sex with men and women... "That's not all.
"Proceed.
I had premarital sex with men and women... ...participated in many lustful orgies.
Really?
What?
Continue I have helped in the murder of a priest.
I do not want this life anymore.
I want all this death to stop.
Can you hear me brother?
Brother?
Sarina, what are you doing?
I thought I heard something.
Our work here is done.
Wasn't that a lovely ... Wasn't that a lovely sermon?
We will have to come again.
Sarina, perhaps you can participate in communion next time.
Let's get off this stagnant island.
I have no more money for you.
-Edward.
Jules!
Jules!
I have something to tell you.
I have something too!
"I have something to say."
"Me too."
Jules!
Jules!
I have something to tell you.
I have something too!
"I have something to say."
"Me too."
Me first.
I go to The Cannon Balls.
First, I walk through the door ... ...and the furniture doesn't really match the decor ... -Edward!
Yes.
Anyway, by my great intellect and a little ... ... Research, I discovered, right now, as we speak ...
Anyway, by my great intellect and a little ... ... Research, I discovered, right now, as we speak ... ... on this island, Victor Stagnett is here.
Why are you wearing this robe?
What did I tell you?
She's a whore to the bone.
...
The wench's crotch ain't dry yet, she's got her talons in another swabee.
Who are you?
"Shut you mouth land lubber!"
"Marcos, why are you doing this?"
Is this your new victim?
No, I've known him since I was a child, he's my captain.
What is that?
I'll tell you what it is.
Captain is a sexual petname.
That's what it means.
Sea Witch.
I loved you so much.
I wish you didn't exist.
And when you act like this I wish you didn't exist.
I loved you so much.
I wish you didn't exist.
And when you act like this I wish you didn't exist.
Shut your mouth.
She won't hurt any more men.
And when you act like this I wish you didn't exist.
Shut your mouth.
She won't hurt any more men.
What does that mean?
That means I will not let you hurt other men.
What does that mean?
That means I will not let you hurt other men.
This is a misunderstanding.
Silence!
You both are going to die.
What!?
Surprise!
Don't worry, my darling.
They're not going to hurt you.
But if you don't put on a show, they will.
Don't worry, my darling.
They're not going to hurt you.
But if you don't put on a show, they will.
So relax and enjoy yourself.
Look me hartees what we have captured.
What should I do with her?
Take her clothes off!
Want to see what's under this dress?
"Let go, what are you doing to me?"
"Fiery Spaniard!"
That's great.
Keep up that fighting.
They love it.
Release me!
Oh, I'll release you from these garments that hide your beauty.
Is this what you wanted to see?
Yes!
Aye!
Aaargh!
I'm going to kill you when I'm free.
Yes!
Aye!
Aaargh!
I'm going to kill you when I'm free.
I won't give you the pleasure of calling you a whore!
So, you want to be difficult?
I'll show you what we do with your kind.
If anyone of you touch me, I'll cut you.
No stop you bitch, I'll bite your nipples.
Not before I do.... You'll like this.
"Stop I'm married."
"All the better."
Stop.
Oh!
That feels good.
Uhh!
Oh, Don't stop.
Uhhh!
Aaarghhh!
oh!
Aaarghh!
I don't know if we should do this.
What do you mean?
Look what she's done to you.
Maybe if she and I spent some time together.
Maybe we could get it back to the way it was before.
Maybe my balls could turn into breasts.
don't be foolish.
She's incapable of loving anyone.
I don't know what to do.
Marco look at me!
You're a great white shark... With huge daggers for teeth.
And you're swimming around in the oceans of this world.
Out there in front of you is tender vittles.
...dolphins, tuna, there sweet little bodies.
All you gotta do is take a bite!
...with those big dagger teeth.
You're gold matie!
Spanish gold!
You're telling me you don't know what to do with those big dagger teeth!
You're right.
I'm gold, spanish gold.
You're a shark.
"I'm a shark!"
Burn this place down.
Go get the dolphins, matie.
Yeah!
Nice work Jules!
"It's not my fault."
I thought you were a virgin.
"It's not my fault."
I thought you were a virgin.
Edward, do you smell something?
I thought you were a virgin.
Edward, do you smell something?
What?
Something's burning.
Yeah, it's probably your pussy from all the action you've been getting.
Shut up!
How are we going to get out of here?
What do we do now Jules?
I don't know, Edward.
What was your news?
I found out about Victor and where he's going.
Where?
What was your news about Victor?
You're absolutely right Jules.
Something definitely is burning!
I don't think its your crotch.
Oh no!
I think matters may have just gotten worse.
Pretty lady carried by 2 men there's always a pretty lady being carried around by 2 men.
Wouldn't be a normal day otherwise.
Wouldn't go down there if I was you.
Edward, my love.
Angelina, untie us.
No.
Jules: No?
What do you mean, no?
You going to let us die?
Maybe.
Jules:"Please untie us.
This place will collapse!"
Edward has to prove that he loves me.
How?
Make love to me, here, now.
You don't want to go someplace safe?
Make love to me, here, now.
You don't want to go someplace safe?
No.
It must be now.
We could all die.
I would rather die, than not to have your love inside of me.
Edward, fuck her now!
OK. OK. OK.
I'll do it.
Better satisfy me.
Oh!
Oh!, Yeah!
Ooooh!
Oh.
Oh.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah!
Oh fuck me!
Can we untie her and go?
Thank you ladies.
That was quite lovely.
I'm sorry we grabbed you like that.
But our other dancer did'nt show up.
How can we pay you for your services?
Well, I could use some potassium nitrate.
Potassium nitrate!
What does a woman need that for?
I have a rat problem.
Well then, you're in luck.
This is a supply room for black powder.
Take what you like.
I will thank you.
You're the best partner I've ever had.
Have you ever been with a woman?
Actually no.
Have some grog my friend.
But I want to live the life of a pirate hunter!
It's not a life for delicate flowers like yourself.
But... No buts.
One day I promise, I'll return.
You promise with all your heart?
Yeah...the whole thing.
Bye bye.
Goodbye, my sweet pirate hunter.
She's insane.
Yeah...I know.
Let's go.
Sarina.
You disappoint me.
What do you mean?
Are you losing your cruelty?
Becoming more compassionate?
No, Victor.
Good.
Otherwise I would have no use for you.
Helmsman, weigh anchor.
Prepare to sail southwest.
Aye, aye, Sir.
This is where we're going.
Cabarrus Island.
No one have ever come back from there alive.
You couldn't say that unless somebody had.
You poor Edward.
Thank you, Woo.
Well there's the viscious lady I remember.
Don't ever second guess me.
I sensed compassion.
I don't trust a compassionate pirate.
You question me after the blood I spilled for you.
Vigilance is what kept me alive until now.
Not vigilant enough.
I guess not.
I've sensed weakness within you as well.
What is that my dear?
You have become so obsessed with your quest that... ...you have forgotten man's most basic desire....lust.
Without that you are nothing.
you're not even a man.
And what do you know of desire?
I desire 2 things.
Man's blood upon my blade... And this.
What are you going to do Sarina?
It's not what I'm going to do.
It's what you're going to do.
Now lick it!
And if I don't?
Now lick it!
And if I don't?
Then I will slit your throat and celebrate my new position... as Captain of the Devil's Rose.
Lick it!
That's my girl.
Uoh!
Vic, vic, vic!
Oh...Oh!
OOO!
ooh Don't ever second guess me again.
I love him so much.
And now he's just gone.
Isabella, if he is alive I promise we will find him.
Even if we find him, he won't love me anymore.
What do you mean?
I broke my vow to be faithful to him.
You were married 7 days.
Who'd you sleep with?
Don't tell me you slept with Woo Chou.
No, no, no.
I was captured by pirates.
Some pirates were throwing a bachelor party.
They only had one girl to put on a show.
So they captured me and...
...I was the other girl.
They forced you to sleep with her?
Not really.
At the beginning I resisted.
But then I... "You enjoyed it."
"I really enjoyed it".
You didn't do anything that horrible.
Besides most men like it.
Really?
Absolutely.
They encourage it.
Maybe Manuel will too.
I love Manuel so much.
I can't see myself being with another man.
But there was something about her.
So different.
A woman knows how to touch a woman.
I like it too.
"You do?"
"Yes."
Can I feel it again with you?
I don't know that... mmmm... mmm... "Slap me harder."
"Yeah?"
"Yeah."
....oooo.... You are fiesty.
You like this?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'll lick it.
Yeah, baby.
Oh yeah.
Oh my.
Oh my.
Oh my.
Oh, oh, fuck yeah.
Oh, oh, oh.
Fuck me.
Come.
A lucky pirate captain, I am.
To have such beauty and lethality at my command.
Blessed that you are not hunting little ol' me.
I am your first mate.
You are my captain.
...until death do us part.
All done, Jules.
I'm fine.
That's an order.
Go to bed.
You can't kill him tonight.
Besides, I need you strong when the time comes.
I never thought such callousness could be found in man.
It will be over soon.
Trust me.
Please.
Go to bed.
What happened here?
What are all these ships?
These are the ships of those who failed... ...in the task I will triumph.
Look.
Can you see her in the distance?
Calabarus Island.
Sarina, get Manuel.
Where are we?
All the ships there?
We're close to Calabarus Island.
I can feel death... ...permeating my skin.
I can too.
Hold me Woo.
Get away.
Knock it off.
You only need to worry about Victor's blade.
Where?
There it is, Devil's Rose.
Remain calm.
He's anchoring on the west end.
Let me see.
I don't think he spotted us.
We'll have to assume he has.
Helmsman, take us to the east end.
Isabella, Oxford arm yourself.
This could be dangerouse and a trap.
Oxford.
Yes my captain.
Stay with the boat.
Aye captain.
Listen.
you must be quiet.
We don't want to make noise to alert them.
Aye captain.
Alright.
Stay with me, stay close.
Once inside, do not touch anything.
Stay behind me.
Stop!.
Wait!
This looks like a trap.
Stand back.
False alarm.
Let's go.
Look.
There's a light ahead.
This is it.
Are you sure?
Want to scout around?
No.
This is the image I saw.
OK.
Follow me.
Stay close.
Who knows what dangers may lurk.
There you are my ancient friend.
It's so beautiful!
Even more beautiful in my hand.
This place is scary.
I agree.
This is not a happy cave.
We should have brought more men.
What!
More men?
We don't need more.
My body is a battalion of destruction!
Anyone who dares....What was that?
Relax.
I just stepped on a rock.
It's OK.
I was just testing reflexes.
Keep moving.
Your ancestor saved Prince Aluhuapa from the conquistador.
Your family was honored custodian... ...of the Sceptre of Inca!
Only a true descendant can retrieve the Sceptre.
You!
So.
Here we are.
Now give me the Sceptre.
So I can show the world who is king.
Isabella you're alive!
No, don't hurt him!
I can play like you.
Release him or I'll kill your whore.
Do it.
I'd be glad to rid me of her scurvy vagina.
What?!
No one will stop me wielding the power of the Sceptre.
Give it up Victor.
The forces of evil are always outweighed by the forces of good.
I never finished my victory speech.
Oh well.
Kill them.
Kill them all.
I thought we were partners.
Sorry my dear.
Have a nice death.
Bones.
Is that the best you got, Pirate Wizard?
Bones?
They can't be bad.
Just skeletons.
Dead skeletons tell no tales.
Ashes to ashes.
Bones to dust.
How do you kill bones?
It's alright everyone.
No need to worry.
I'm unscathed.
A little tangled up there.
Sorry I couldn't free myself... ...in time to help you...
I think they're coming back.
Now's your chance, Edward.
Run.
Run!
Oxford!
Oxxxfooorrdd!
Sir?
Oxford, prepare the boat!
What's the hurry?
the boat!
Turn the fucking boat around.
Fuck me!
Go hurry!
Weigh anchor men.
It's time to celebrate.
Well done captain.
How does being 2nd in command of the world sound?
An honor, sir.
Spread the news.
Pirates, let's get this piece of wood a drifting!
Men to the riggings.
Isabella.
Take Manuel below deck.
We have to catch Victor before he sets sail.
He'll be sailing south.
We'll cut them off.
Weigh anchor and set sail.
All hands, make way.
There she is.
All hands to battle stations!
All hands!
Pass her on the port side.
Aye captain.
She's coming around our port side.
How do you know?
I don't know.
It's all the fun part of sailing.
Steady boys she's almost in position.
Get ready crew!
Stand fast men.
Shiver me timbers..the fool survived.
Aye.
She's yours to destroy captain.
Such a pretty ship.
Keep coming.
Fire at will!
The mast and rudder are damaged!
Damn it you bloody pirates!
I just cleaned it!
Death to the pirate scallywags.
Woo, fire!
I thought you fixed this Woo?
It's not my fault.
It should've worked.
Piece of shit!
Please tell me this is part of your plan.
Should get credit if my next plan works.
Come about and let me finish them off!
She's coming around again.l OK.
I've a new plan of action.
Woo, make those cannons work or we're all dead!
Wait she's almost there.
She's a fish without a tail.
Point at her and fire.
Woo, you're the only one that can save us.
Make those cannons work.
Too much pressure, Edward.
I don't work well under pressure.
Come to papa broadside.
Ready?
Ready.
Woo, fire the cannons.
Jules: fire in the hole!
She's got us!
From Davey Jones' locker I stab at thee!
We killed him!
Yeahhhh!
Well done men!
I think I shit my pants!
It's over.
I sunk the Devil's Rose.
We're really pirate hunters now.
Guess my plans weren't so bad?
Were they?
It's so good to look in your eyes again.
I miss swimming in their beauty.
I missed you as well.
But I must confess something.
What?
I was not faithful to you.
What do you mean?
I slept with a woman.
Well, not just one woman but two.
You did?
Yeah, but I didn't mean for it to happen at first.
The second time I started it.
Did you enjoy it?
Yes.
Would you do it again?
Yes.
Do you hate me?
No.
I love you!
Think maybe I can see you with another woman?
Maybe you could join us too.
I knew I married the right woman.
Oh!
Oh, yeah!
Oh my gosh!
Fuck yeah!
Oh my gah, yeah!
Oh Yeah!
Oh, Manuel!
You like that cock inside you?
Yeah, come on.
Fuck that pussy!
Wow!
Want my come?
Here it comes!
So you happy to see her or should we have her walk the plank?
Yes.
It is good to be together once again.
I cannot thank you enough for caring for my wife.
Please, no reason to thank me.
She took care of us.
Edward, I don't even know how to begin to thank you.
You've been a magnificent captain.
You just did.
You alright?
I thought he loved me.
He couldn't love.
Evil's incapable of such beauty.
I lied to myself.
I wanted to belong to something.
I killed for him.
I was a vicious....murderer.
That life is over.
You can be whatever you wanna be.
You're free now.
To do what?
To make peace.
To live a life of honor and virtue.
...with us.
I'm a pirate.
No.
You helped us.
You are now... and forever... a pirate hunter.
Spit on my cunt.
Give me more.
More.
There it goes.
Smack my pussy.
What are you going to do now?
These waters are full of thousands of pirates.
So I've heard.
One down.
A thousand more to go.
Drink up me hartees.
Sarina is now hunting...
[Man] The ship's comin'in.
The ship's comin'in.
Hey, nipper.
Where's everybody goin'?
The privateer ship's comin' in.
The Mermaid.!
It's tyin'up.!
Come on.
Let's go!
The ship's comin' in!
Hey, home port never seemed so good, eh?
No sight of me old lady.
I'm guess I'm in luck.
[Laughing] Ship's comin'in.
Ship's comin'in.
Ship's comin'in.
Women!
Let me at 'em!
[Laughing, Chattering] Boat comin' in.
Three years it's been.
Looks like all the lassies in London come down to meet us.
Don't keep 'em waiting.
I'll pipe you ashore, mates.
Hold it!
You sailors stand where you are.
You are Captain Bart Paxton?
I am.
To Bart Paxton, master of the Mermaid... commissioned privateer by order issued under the authority of his gracious majesty... Charles II, your ship is declared quarantine.
No officer or crew may leave ship under penalty of naval law.
Except you, sir.
Have the goodness to accompany me.
Have I any choice?
No, sir.
A carriage is waiting for you on the dock.
After three years on a scurvy deck... they'll not keep me out of London tonight.
Me, neither.
I'll nip a herring in Gin Lane or know the reason why.
I'll jump ship!
Go over the side and you'll part company with me.
I'm pledged to obey Admiralty orders.
But, Captain, we've been six month without sight of a female!
If I can't pipe us ashore, we'll pipe them aboard!
[Cheering] [Chattering] Ho there, Kipper.
You're a bit young for that party.
I think you'd best go with me.
Where to, sir?
I don't know.
That seems to be the red coats' secret.
You want me, Captain?
No.
The boy is going with me.
Do I need an escort to a dingy rum house?
A certain gentleman acquaintance of yours is waiting for you inside, Captain.
Right this way, please.
You'd better stay here, Kipper.
Aye, aye, Captain.
In here, sir.
Sir Francis Crawford!
Bart, you young scoundrel.
Sorry to use these cloak-and-dagger tactics to get you here.
But, uh... what I have to tell you is not exactly official Admiralty business.
Thought you were still royal governor in Madras.
I'm dry-docked to the Admiralty now.
Sit down, Bart.
Sit down.
Glass of sherry?
Bart, I've an assignment for you in the West Indies.
It's going to make what we did in Madras look like child's play.
We scuttled a few galleons together, didn't we?
[Sighs] There's no more adventure since we've made the peace with Spain.
The armistice has changed England's problems a bit... but it hasn't ended them.
You've heard of Henry Morgan?
That blood-soaked pirate!
Surely you wouldn't be asking me to serve with him.
No.
Destroy him.
Morgan's returned to his old trade... buccaneering.
I want you to root him out ofTortuga.
Wipe his fleet from the seas.
[Inhales] It might be done... if I could muster some of my old officers who served with me when I was Royal Navy.
Gentlemen officers?
Pirates don't fight like English gentlemen.
There are no rules of war in Morgan's book.
The three gentlemen I'm thinking of could sink the devil.
Then get them.
I've already ordered your ship to be refitted.
Ha!
Ah!
Kipper, do you think you can find these addresses for me?
With my eyes closed, sir.
Ha!
[Man] Stop, thief!
She stole my purse.!
Stop.!
Stop, thief!
You talking to me, mister?
Get in, fox.
The hounds are at your heels.
Let go of me, you blasted gentleman!
Thank you, sir.
Come on, you little thief.
It's the gallows for you.
Wait a minute.
The gallows?
Just for stealing a purse?
It's the law.
Get 'em!
They're working together.
I'll split you from head to heart!
Watch out, bucko!
That's the way!
Come on!
Use your toad sticker!
Slit his gizzard!
Come on!
You bilge rats!
[Laughs] That dirty scum.
He made me spill all my coppers!
Your coppers?
Finders, keepers, says I.
Anyway, who's particular?
The law that punishes petty thievery.
Who's a thief?
I am an actress.
With, uh, two very visible assets I'd say.
[Bagpipe] That's my ship.
You'll be safe enough now.
Oh!
One piece of advice, though.
If you hope to continue with your... your acting career... you're gonna have to learn to keep your hands in your own purse.
I'll do without your advice, sailor.
And never fear...
The gypsy told me I ain't gonna end on no gallows... be whipped in no stocks or be shipped to no colonies.
Because I'm smart, that's what.
Hey!
My name is Meg.
What's yours?
Nice meeting you.
Good-bye.
[Chattering] The three gentlemen are waiting in the wardroom, Captain Bart.
Good lad!
Kipper, tell Bonnet to start clearing the deck.
This hulk's beginning to smell like Gin Lane.
Aye, aye, Captain.
Let's have another drink.
Ahoy there, girlie.
Let go of me, you blasted bilge rat.
Now, you wouldn't have let anybody get away with that a year ago.
[All Laughing] Percy.
Dripping lace like an admiral's gig.
Would never have known you.
Any lady got her grappling hooks into you yet, Reggie, my lad?
Oh, I can still outsail the best of'em, Bart.
Well, look, never mind about us, Bart.
What brought you home so quick?
I have a need for your talents.
I have a cruise in mind that'll take the stench of the land out of your lungs... that is if you, uh, still have the stomach for adventure.
Oh!
Soft!
[Laughs] [Sighs] Oh!
Captain!
And me in my boudoir.
But...
However... Oh.
Oh, please.
Captain!
How can you take such liberties?
But...
However... Mmm.
[Laughs] [Chuckles] But, Bart, it makes no sense.
Only last year, the Crown was lavishing honors on Henry Morgan.
Yes.
Gave the cutthroat a knighthood and a governor's palace.
Ayear ago, we were at war with Spain.
England had no fleet in the Americas.
The Spaniards did.
We could've lost that war 3,000 miles from home.
Morgan was our only naval strength in the Caribbean.
Ah.
So, we had to pay his price?
Now he's more powerful than ever.
Only one out of every 10 of our own ships manages to escape him in those waters.
Sheesh!
Nine out of 10.
That's a pretty fat haul for Morgan.
[Gasps] Lord love a duck!
Sparklers!
Fit for a duchess.
Too bad that blasted sailor can't see me now.
[Giggles] Our Crown colony ofJamaica is starving.
Not one ship has gotten through in months.
Morgan's men patrol those waters like a pack of hungry sharks, devouring everything.
And he's turned the Island ofTortuga into a buccaneer kingdom.
This Tortuga... is it too strong for a British fleet to crack open?
If the Royal Navy were to attack Tortuga... Britain would be plunged back into war with Spain.
Well, um, just exactly what does Sir Francis expect us to do?
Acting on our own... unofficially as privateers... we can provision Jamaica then smash Morgan.
One old ship and half a hundred men... to conquer a pirate kingdom?
That from the best gunnery officer in the Royal Navy.
We fought odds almost as great before.
And the Mermaid's being fitted with new cannon and all the powder she can hold.
Well, it's impossible, of course, for anybody but us.
What happens if we get caught?
If we got caught, the Admiralty won't be able... to pull our chestnuts out of the fire this time.
And if we succeed?
There will be no reward too great.
I have that on the word of Sir Francis Crawford himself.
Any more questions?
When do we up anchor, Captain?
We sail with the tide.
[Door Opens] Oh, Captain.
You startled me.
But...
However... Get out of my bed.
On your feet and fast!
Don't you talk to me like that!
That ain't the way to get on my good side.
Who invited you into my cabin?
I invited myself.
That butcher was waiting at the dock.
You wouldn't want me chopped into a sausage, would you?
[Laughing] It might be an improvement.
What's the matter with you?
Ain't I swell enough for you now that you've got a good look?
I am what I am and I'm proud of it!
There's duchesses that's got no more than me.
Some I've seen had less.
Put me in silk.
Give me a little jewelry.
You couldn't tell me from a fine lady.
Well?
Cat got your tongue?
Could you tell me from a lady?
It, uh, takes more than silks to make a lady.
What's a lady got I ain't got?
Something... Something in her manner that makes a man take off his hat.
All the silks of Cathay on you... and you'd still be what you are.
Common?
Let's say... untaught.
Listen, you blowfish.
I'll see the day you doff your hat to me!
That's what!
Anything is possible.
In the meantime, here's half-a-crown.
Take it and... You grubby smelt!
You fancy barnacle!
Bilge rat!
You have a pretty salty vocabulary for a street duchess.
I rather like you in a rage.
Oh, yes?
Then you're going to fall in love with me!
[Laughing] If she doesn't leave soon, drop her over the side.
Aye, aye, sir.
But, uh, take care.
The lady has claws.
Aye, aye, sir.
Brushin' me off with a half-a-crown.
Half-a-crown?
Common, says he.
Oh, Meg!
The sight of you would melt an earl!
Or maybe a king.
[Man] Let go top gallants.!
Make fast forwardjib.
[Man #2] Delay main brace.
Port gunman at the ready.!
Port batteries loaded and ready, Lieutenant.
We'll dispense with naval rank this cruise, Bonnet.
Aye, aye, sir.
Chain bolts on number three.
They're too loose.
Gunner, your slow match is too short.
Could blow your head off.
Percy... you look a sight more seaworthy than the London dancing master who signed on.
A whiff of salt and I grew back my fins, Bart.
Can you lend me another powder monkey?
Kipper!
Aye, aye, sir.
Lend a hand.
Aye, aye, sir.
I say!
Is somebody boarding the ship?
Pee Wee giving some pointers to the crew.
[Grunting] Very good.
All right now, gentlemen.
Enough of the finesse.
I can't tell you how to use one of these things.
You all know that.
Otherwise you wouldn't be on this ship.
But I can tell you the gentlemen we are going to meet... within the course of the next few days... have no set of rules when it comes to deck-fighting.
So when there are no rules, you make up your own.
And here are one or two that may be useful to you.
We'll try you.
Now, wait.
Wait.
Whoa, whoa.
Now, now just relax and take it easy.
Huh?
Now hold that.
Now that... is lesson number one... never trust anybody.
Now gimme the pigsticker.
And that is lesson number two.
Never turn your back on anybody.
Remember, men, the next time won't be practice.
So lively does it!
Range 200, on the up wave... fire!
[Cheering] Not bad for a beginning.
Now, for the starboard guns!
[Meg] Let me out.!
Let me out ofhere.!
Let me out, you bilge rats.!
Open it up.!
Let me out.!
Let me out.!
Let me out.
Let me out.!
Open it.!
Let me out.!
Let me out!
Let me out of here!
Let me out...
I thought there was a battle.
[Bart] All right.
Topside, you.
I told you to drop her off at the dock.
There was no sign of the lass in your cabin afore we shoved off.
I had no wish to sail on your rotten boat.
But that butcher was waiting on the dock to slice my gizzard.
What are you doing in that dress?
I didn't steal it.
Just wanted you to see I could look like a lady.
Well!
Personal cargo, Bart?
Stowaway!
Of course, you could, uh, put her over the side in a longboat.
She might drown!
Or worse, she might not.
I'd drop you over the side but you'd only poison the fish.
I don't mind a short sea voyage.
You've got one!
Three months.
Three months!
Just where do you filthy swabs think you're taking me?
You're on your way to the colonies, my girl.
The colonies!
You'll take your meals with us.
You'll sleep...
There's a sail locker under the wheel deck.
It's yours till we put you ashore in Jamaica.
What do you expect me to do in Jamaica?
Use those brains you're so proud of... and you'll stand a better chance of avoiding the hangman's rope... if you'll stop trying to look like a lady.
Why, you dirty kidnapper!
Your quarters!
Stay in 'em!
With pleasure.
And just see that you and your other bilge rats stay out!
One other thing... Wash your face, lady.
[Grunts] [Laughing] Go ahead and laugh, you grinning hyenas.
A trim looking bit of goods.
Yes, and the longer we're at sea, the trimmer she's going to look... to me.
The man that opens that door gets himself a keg of trouble.
But you must admit, Bart... that little trouble has a well-turned ankle.
The starboard cannon have a well-turned barrel, Gunnery Officer Percy.
I wonder if she'd like to learn the minuet.
[Chuckling] [Sobbing] What did I do now?
Why, you didn't do anything.
You just entered the room.
Oh.
You sit there.
Are you swabs going to do that every time I get up?
It's customary.
When a lady rises.
Sit down, gentlemen.
A bit of, uh, chicken, my little dove?
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh.
Sweet child... a lady, when she drinks, holds her glass so.
With the little pinkie raised so.
You're wasting your time, Mr. Gunnery Officer.
I think she's doing rather well.
Him?
He wouldn't know a lady if she up and bit him.
Ladies don't bite.
This one does.
And you've got the marks to prove it.
[Meg Laughing] [Bonnet] Three passes in a row the lassie's made.
One more, and I'll have your pantaloons!
Come on.
Get your coppers down, mates.
Here's 10!
Here's five shillings.
You cannot beat that, lass!
[Laughing] I never seen such luck.
A run of fantastic luck for a ruddy fact.
Which I'll put an end to.
Back to your quarters, men.
A lady doesn't crawl around on the decks dicing with the crew.
Why, you blabbermouthed slob!
I won honest.
Really I did!
Neither does a lady go around calling people "blabbermouthed slobs," "stinking squids" or "blasted swabs!"
One of the crew said you was a king.
Are you?
In my land, I was a king with 20,000 warriors at my command.
Then, tell me, what makes a girl a lady?
You know, what they doff their hats to?
I'm not sure I'm the right king to answer that question.
Ain't kings and ladies the same wherever you find them?
That may be true.
Well?
I been improvin' my manners some.
Manners are what you wear on the outside, like clothes.
But thinkin' of other people before yourself... tryin' to help them, that comes from the inside.
Yeah?
And what will they be doing to you while you are tryin' to help them?
Do unto others... Yeah, I see.
It's supposed to work both ways.
No, now, look, Meg.
You haven't quite got it right.
Look, um... You give me the fan.
I'll show you.
Now, first of all, when a lady wants to attract a gentleman's attention... she must flip the fan so... and then walk so.
[Laughs] Flutter the fan... and then flutter the eyelids so.
See?
Now you try it, huh?
That's... No, no.
Wait a minute.
Look.
You haven't got it right.
Just, um, get the, uh, around this way a bit.
Mm-hmm.
That's it.
Now, we, uh, hold the fan there.
That's it.
Now, uh, flutter it.
There you go.
That's it.
See, you learn so quick, don't you?
I appreciate all you're tryin' to learn me, but... do you have to wrestle while you show me!
Trade that fan in for a musket, Pee Wee.
You're in charge of target practice.
Now!
We shall continue the lesson on the afterdeck tonight.
Now, my little dove... we left off our last lesson with the more intimate steps of the minuet.
Come along, child.
Does this go with the minuet?
Like fish goes with chips, sweet child.
The blending of our inner souls.
Inner souls, my foot!
Lieutenant!
There are some nine-pounders on the gun deck... that are more in need of your attention than this baggage.
No need to be so rough on the girl, Bart.
I'm running a fighting ship, not a finishing school!
Aye, aye, sir.
[Whispers] See you on the afterdeck tonight, pigeon.
When I told you to stay away from my crew, that meant my officers as well.
Your jealousy is showing, Captain.
[Laughing] That's more like it.
You haven't changed.
I ain't a lady, yet, but I'm learnin'.
Just what have you learned so far?
That there is other people in the world to think of besides myself.
But it's supposed to work both ways.
Everybody on this ship has tried to help me but you!
You ain't learned me nothin'!
I haven't taught you anything.
That's what I said!
"Taught you."
Not "learned you."
Taught me?
And you'll find a clean change of linen in my sea chest.
Thanks, Bart.
"Fair lady of the..." Waves!
Waves.
[Laughs] "We are your devoted...
slaves."
Yeah, that's good.
Terrible!
No wonder you're still a bachelor.
Looking for someone?
Just seeing to the powder and shot... Moonlight inspection, eh?
Yeah.
And what's the wine for?
Priming the cannon?
[Bagpipes] [Laughing] Well, that does it!
Gentlemen, seeing the young lady has been untrue to us all... shall we drown our tears together?
Right.
Aye.
Sail, ho!
Whereaway?
Off the starboard quarter.!
Big in the belly and a double row of gunports.
It's one of Morgan's flotilla!
At last!
We're in luck.
She'll sight us in a minute.
Sail hands aloft!
The rest of you men man your posts and stay out of sight!
Pee Wee!
[Pee Wee] Aye?
The deck's yours, poet.
Get those women topside on the double.
Bart, I want you to know that only for England would I do this.
A Levantine trader.
Seen a lot of'em... when I was combing the Mediterranean with Morgan.
Slow and cranky by the looks of it.
Steerin' like a mud turtle.
[Chuckles] Take a look at what she's got for a captain.
Oh, it's plain to see he's no Siamese fighting fish.
He wouldn't be this far from home if they weren't loaded to the gunwales with a rich cargo.
We'll lighten her load.
Cut out the sails!
Hoist up theJolly Roger!
We'll scare the juice out of'em.
[Laughs] They're closing under full sail.
Ha, ha, ha, ha Hee, hee Bart?
Bart?
Bart.
Psst.
[Whispering] Bonnet.
Throw her in the brig.
What in the flaming blazes did I do now?
Come along, girls.
Your promenade.
Go!
Get... Come on.
Get in there, now.
Let me out!
Let me out!
Let me out, you scurvy swine!
Roll out the red carpet.
Oh, it'll be red all right.
Gammel, spill the wind out of her sails so they can catch us.
Let me out!
Now, stop.
Stop in the name of the king.
Stop.
I'm Montbars.
The barracuda of Sir Henry Morgan's flotilla.
Don't you wave that...
Surrender your ship, or we'll scuttle ya.
P-Please have mercy, sir.
Please.
I mean, I'm-I'm just Pee Wee... A poltroon.
You know... just a very peaceful man.
[Laughing] And-And-And nothing...
This jellyfish looks soft enough to eat!
Aaah!
L-Look, we have a very rich cargo.
S-Silks and s-spices and... [Laughs] And spices and-and-and... Perhaps we could make a bargain.
A bargain?
What kind, pip-squeak?
[Laughing] What kind ofbargain?
This kind... [Swords Clattering] Are you gonna open this, pig?
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, when you're through with your practicin', will you open this blasted door!
[Clattering Continues] I rolled their cannon over the side, Bart.
Hated to see 'em go, but we've no space on our decks.
I've a mind to cut off your ears as a present for Henry Morgan.
But that's a privilege he may be wanting for himself.
Now get back aboard your ship.
You gonna sink us with all hands?
No.
Send you back to Tortuga.
You have enough canvas left if you don't run into weather... and enough food and water so you don't starve or choke.
Why are you being so generous?
Take a message to Morgan.
The king of the ocean sends his compliments to the king ofTortuga.
Tell him I'm selling my cargo and yours in the market atJamaica for a fancy price.
Then I'll be back for another load.
Bonnet!
Pipe the barracuda aboard his ship.
That'll twist Morgan's tail for him, eh, Bart?
Luck played with us.
But it'll take a lot more than a masquerade to smash Morgan.
All right, men, let's clear these decks!
It looks like a thieves' market.
[Bonnet] All right.
Hop to it, mates.
All right.
Out.
Very considerate of you, Captain.
Just because I've become a lady don't mean I'm so delicate you have to lock me up... every time you hold target practice.
These men weren't wounded in practice.
What happened?
We were attacked by one of Morgan's ships.
You were protecting me.
If you'd stop preening yourself long enough... so you could see further than your own reflection in a glass... maybe you'd make yourself useful for a change.
I didn't grow up in the streets without learning how to patch a busted noggin.
That is, if you don't mind my lending a hand.
I'd be grateful for the help of a real lady.
It's the Chepillo right enough.
Sneaking home with her tail between her legs.
The barracuda's gonna have some mighty tall explaining to do to Morgan, I'm thinking.
[Laughing, Chattering] Go on!
Go!
[Growling] [Growling] [Yells] I'll wage you 10 pieces of eight on the slave, milord.
Always an eye for the big muscles, eh?
[Yells] Go on!
Get him!
[Shouts] If he wins, can I have him?
Which one, the man or the bear?
[Laughing] You ain't won yet, my love.
Get him!
[Laughing] Ten pieces of eight, Lola, my girl.
That's the Morgan luck for you.
From what the Ogeron reports, someone's drawn the barracuda's teeth.
A milksop merchantman.
The Mermaid.
We boarded her and walked into a trap.
Aye.
That it was, Sir Henry.
As bloodthirsty a crew as any in the brotherhood.
They was in hiding and jumped us.
Cut us down before we had a chance.
And yet left you alive to come slinking back here... to Tortuga with your tails between your legs.
Aye, with a message from the captain of the Mermaid.
King of the ocean, he calls himself.
He said to tell you that he'd take the booty he filched off us... and sell it at the marketplace atJamaica.
And then he'd come back again for another cargo.
We gonna let this king of the ocean do this to us, my love?
You blasted idiot!
I've a mind to sling you up from your own yardarm... for letting this mountebank slip through my blockade.
King of the ocean, eh?
Well, we'll soon see how long he keeps his crown.
Could by one of Morgan's ships.
Nah, her flag is British.
A British ship.
Fat with cargo by the looks of her.
How did she slip through the blockade?
Make fast fore and aft.
Here, lad.
Catch this line.
Green lines out.
Standby to take a line there.
Make fast mooring lines, fore and aft!
Well, Jamaica seems mighty pleased to see us, Bart.
They'll be a lot happier when they see the supplies we've got in our hold for 'em.
Make that forward line a little tighter.
Percy, I'd better get those bills of lading ashore... before these good citizens attack us.
Take charge.
All right.
Stealing?
No, just looking.
It's beautiful.
Must be worth a fortune since you keep it so special.
It's worth more than money.
It's my mother's.
Morgan's men overlooked it when they boarded the ship she was sailing on.
Did-Did your mother escape, Bart?
My mother was still a beautiful woman.
Morgan carried her to Tortuga.
She died there.
It cuts deep, don't it?
I think it won't be long before I settle accounts with Henry Morgan.
[Reggie] The merchants are getting impatient.
Coming!
You can, uh, keep that finery you're wearing.
Oh, l...
I couldn't.
Really.
But however... Oh, uh, sail clear of butchers armed with cleavers.
With love to Lady Margaret.
I'm thinking you'll be coming after me, Captain Bart.
Say, who's captain of this ship?
I am.
My name's Randolph.
Buy and sell everything.
Biggest merchant in the colony.
Stevens here.
Tailor.
Did you bring any cloth?
Jason.
Shoemaker.
I need leather badly.
Hawkins here.
I'm a baker.
Did you bring any flour?
You'll all get a chance to bid on our cargo as soon as it's cleared Customs.
I'll handle that for you.
Buy your whole cargo at your price... and take care of Customs out of my own pocket.
Out of our pocket, you mean.
When we have to come to you to buy it.
Give us a chance to bid.
[Men] Yes, give us a chance to bid, Captain.
[Randolph] You'll find Jamaica near starvation thanks to our governor here.
Is this your ship, sir?
The Mermaid, out of London.
Captain Paxton.
Percival SmytheJones, my mate.
At your service, sir.
And I'm Sir Thomas Modyford, royal governor ofJamaica.
Captain, yours is the first ship to make its way through Morgan's blockade in months.
Our own merchants refuse to send their ships out of this harbor.
To lose them to the pirates?
They'll rest safer in port, thank you.
The pirates gave you no trouble, sir?
None we weren't prepared for.
It appears you came through without a scratch.
A few bites.
But Montbars, the barracuda, came off the worse for it.
Captain Paxton here had more luck than your flotilla, Sir Thomas.
Morgan's ships jumped my fleet before the wind had caught the sails.
They have an efficient spy system here in Jamaica.
I thought it was England's policy to keep hands offTortuga.
Paper policy may do for London, sir.
But it is not mine to cringe under piracy without striking a blow.
Let's get down to business.
If you'll just give me your bills of lading, Captain.
Sir Thomas, as a merchant I must turn a profit... but I'll not trade on human misery.
I'll be grateful if you'd accept the responsibility... for seeing to it that my cargo's distributed at a fair price.
Gladly, but...
It seems the quickest way... to get it to those who need it the most.
I promise you speed and fair dealing, sir.
And I promise you're a fool, Captain.
As soon as we've dropped cargo, we'll set sail... and try and get another shipload through to you.
You're a brave man, Captain Paxton.
Generous and brave.
I hope my luck holds.
Thank you, Captain.
Thank you, Captain.
Gentlemen, your help will be appreciated to set a fair value... on Captain Paxton's merchandise.
That we will, sir.
We will, sir.
I shall clear this with the Customs inspector at once.
Sir Thomas, excepting for one flaw, you'd be a first-class governor.
You trust people.
Has it crossed your mind that this man Paxton may be one of Morgan's men?
Does it seem reasonable that one of Morgan's spies... would go to that length to gain our confidence?
Highly reasonable.
When only one ship in almost a year... has gotten past Morgan's blockade... and her captain can hardly wait to put back to sea.
I, for one, would like to know something more about him... before I give him my full trust.
Good day, Sir Thomas.
Meg, I hear you're leaving us.
So the captain has told me.
But what are you going to do in Jamaica?
I might return to my career in the theater.
Here.
Here's a sovereign, just to help tide you over.
And here's another.
A lady should have money in her purse.
Thank you, sirs.
Welcome toJamaica, milady.
Can we be of any service?
Well, I'd like to find an inn.
To be sure.
To be sure.
Johnson, fetch a carriage.
Follow me, milady.
We shall start the distribution of these goods first thing in the morning.
[Meg Screaming] [Meg Grunting] Down that street!
Hurry!
[Screaming Continues] Let go!
[Screams] Help me get this lady to the carriage.
The doctor said she'd be unconscious for several hours yet.
There's no need for you to remain, Thomas.
I'll stay with her.
Thank you, Phoebe.
Lovely.
I wonder who she could be.
Patience, Thomas.
The girl will tell us soon enough.
I've seen more cheerful faces dangling from a gallows.
It's just that, well... something's missing.
Yeah.
Little Meg.
I don't know.
The ship seems sort of... empty without her.
Quieter too.
It was a cruel thing, Bart... to set a poor, defenseless creature adrift in a strange port.
Don't you worry about Meg.
She can take care of herself.
Let go of me!
Let go of me!
She's coming around.
Poor little thing.
Miss.
Miss!
Miss... Lady Margaret.
That wharf rat, he hit me!
He... [Thomas] It's all right, Lady Margaret.
Try not to think of it, Lady Margaret.
You're safe here with us.
I'm Thomas Modyford, governor ofJamaica... and this is my cousin's widow, Phoebe Weldon.
You've been unconscious, my dear, but the doctor says you'll be fine after a rest.
How... How did I get here?
Later.
You still have some recovering to do.
Try to sleep.
Phoebe will stay with you.
You're very kind.
And you are very lovely, Lady Margaret.
Thomas, where do you think she came from?
We've heard nothing of the arrival of a Lady Margaret.
[Thomas] I'm sure there's a very simple explanation.
Her confusion is quite natural, Phoebe.
The doctor said she might suffer a loss of memory.
The doctor ordered rest, Lady Margaret.
I'm Lady Margaret.
Yes, so you've told us.
What a beautiful necklace.
An heirloom?
Yes.
It belonged to my mother.
[No Audible Dialogue] [Harp] Customs must have changed in London.
When I left, backgammon was all the rage.
I win again.
That's 14 pounds you owe me, Sir Thomas.
[Chuckles] Our doctor hopes that as the effects of the blow clear up, you will remember everything.
But I don't want to.
I don't want to remember anything that happened before I came here.
I'm glad.
It's your turn to shake the dice, Sir Thomas.
But...
However... Perhaps you'd rather like to take a stroll in the garden?
The king of the ocean.
Run up the signals!
If it weren't for Morgan's orders...
I'd throw a broadside into his hull.
Well, if he doesn't answer our signals, let's blow him apart.
They're signaling us to follow them, Bart.
Could be a trap.
Follow them, Mr. Gunnery Officer.
Follow them and we'll find out.
But keep your powder dry.
Tell Morgan he's got a royal visitor.
Drink with them, joke with them... but above all, keep your wits about you and a sharp eye open.
When we leave Tortuga... this map will have to show fortifications... number and position of cannon... powder magazines, arsenals... the best landing places and routes of approach.
Everything that we'll need to know for an invasion... and we have to carry it all in our heads.
That's rather a large order, Bart.
Not if we split memory four ways.
Pee Wee, check the fortifications.
Percy, the gun positions.
Powder magazines and arsenals, Reggie.
I'll take the landing places and routes of approach.
Good luck, gentlemen, and remember... in Tortuga we are not gentlemen.
King of the ocean, eh?
Have we met before?
Did you ever ship under me?
Ship under you!
[Laughs] Well, not unless you're the king of England.
I served him for a while, then I went back to serving myself.
If I were king of England, you wouldn't serve me.
You'd be my partner.
Your partner?
Sink me if I don't admire your gall.
This way, Your Majesty.
After you, Your Majesty.
This is the captain of the Zuyder Zee.
He claims the Dutch governor of Curacao will pay his ransom.
Well, for your sake, I hope you're right... because it's either ransom or the rope.
Sir Henry is so softhearted with sailors.
We have no market here for white slaves... or for our plundered cargoes either.
But there is... a rich market... and only I hold the key.
Out!
Everybody out!
Not my captains!
Captains stay.
Now, Paxton, you've been my guest for a while... and we've done our best to treat you... royally.
True?
That you have.
You've entertained us like visiting sultans.
But I didn't come here on a pleasure cruise.
I didn't think you had... otherwise my forts would have sunk you in the harbor.
When you looted the barracuda's ship, you hurt my purse... not to mention my pride.
Bring Sir Henry a little balm for his pride.
What did you send them for?
Sir Henry, I don't think you trust me.
Oh, like my own right hand.
Here's your tally book, Captain.
If you'll put that pistol down a minute... take a look at that.
On him, you knuckle brain!
"Received from Captain Montbars: One gold ring with ruby... 90 pounds... 27 bolts silk cloth at 22 shillings... 100 hogshead of fine Canary..." By the devil's teeth, what's this?
Bookkeeping.
A complete list of everything I received from you and what it brought in Jamaica... minus a small percentage for my trouble, of course.
And here is your half share of the partnership, Your Majesty.
In good coin of the realm.
Care to count it?
Well, split my skull!
[Laughs] With what we've got salted away here in Tortuga... we can keep you busy for the next 10 years... partner!
[Both Laugh] That's the last load.
Our holds are bulging.
And so will be my coffers when you return, partner.
No chance you'd be forgetting to do that, would there, now?
What, and lose another rich cargo?
No, Morgan.
I value our partnership too highly for that.
Get those long boats back to the ship.
[Chattering] How about me making the run to Kingston?
You never take me anyplace.
How about me making the run to Kingston?
You never take me anyplace.
What do you mean?
Didn't I take you to the siege of Panama?
And keep your eyes off Captain Paxton, or I'll lash the hide off your back.
Go on.
Back to the stronghold.
Now, there are four six-foot walls about here.
Arsenal and powder magazine here.
And here, two batteries of nine-pounders.
Gentlemen... that completes a very pretty picture.
Now all we need is an army and a fleet.
Let's hope we can convince Sir Thomas to supply both.
Tonight I must insist upon pleasure before business, Captain.
The Lady Margaret is the most refreshingly charming woman in the world.
Isn't she, Phoebe?
So you've said at least 10 times, Sir Thomas.
And that's the way a man in love should feel, I'd judge.
Judge for yourself, my friend.
[Footsteps Approaching] Each hour increases your beauty, Lady Margaret.
Captain Paxton, the Lady Margaret... my bride to be.
You said I'd be charmed.
I'm staggered.
She's kind enough to pretend to enjoy our simple colonial life after London society.
You look as though you've met the Lady Margaret before, Captain.
Indeed I have.
The lady was a passenger aboard my ship.
Splendid.
Then you can clear up the mystery still clouding Lady Margaret's mind.
She received a blow on the head from a dock ruffian and cannot remember her last name.
Her name... is Darcy.
Lady Margaret Darcy.
Oh, Darcy.
Oh.
It all comes back to me now.
Oh, thank you, Captain.
You're a lifesaver.
Always glad to help a lady.
I cannot tell you how she has brightened this gloomy palace.
And I am enchanted with the new London expressions.
So colorful.
Rather astonishing, I'd say.
Isn't it time for dinner, Thomas?
I'm sure Captain Paxton would rather eat than chatter.
After dinner, I promise to desert the ladies and give business my full attention.
I'll assemble the Colonial Council here tomorrow afternoon.
I hope they're as ready for the fight as you are, sir.
Your map should put some fire under them.
[Meg Whispers] Bart.!
Bart, you're an angel.
And I like the name of Darcy.
It was my mother's maiden name.
Then you won't give me away, will you?
I haven't yet decided, Lady Margaret.
I didn't steal it.
I only took it so you'd come after me.
Yet you used it to deceive a gentleman.
You don't really intend to marry Sir Thomas?
Why not?
No one else has asked me.
He's a fine man, Meg, and... Meg is gone forever.
Don't you understand it?
I've changed!
Have you?
Lay off!
Lay off, you swab!
No, you shouldn't.
Now ask yourself if it's Sir Thomas you love.
Hey!
You forgot your necklace.
It's my belief, gentlemen, that this map... will be the means to destroy Morgan's stronghold.
But I'd be less than honest if I didn't point out that the cost may be high in men... and in money.
One question, Sir Thomas, before we risk either.
How was Captain Paxton here able to map Tortuga... when none of us had been able to get within sight of it?
Can it be that he's secretly on good terms with Morgan?
I remind you, sir, Captain Paxton is a guest under my roof.
What better place for a Morgan spy to hide than under your roof?
We know nothing of this man, nor where he got his rich cargo.
It seems to me that it's quite possible he leads us into a trap.
Your point would be well taken, Mr. Randolph, with one exception: I hear the captain has already served the Crown as a privateer.
I say scratch a privateer and you'll find a pirate.
Piracy's a serious charge, Mr. Randolph.
Are you prepared to back it up?
Piracy is no private matter, Randolph.
If Captain Paxton is charged with piracy, I will bring him to trial.
If he or any other man is found guilty, I will hang him.
Are you prepared to make a formal charge?
No.
Not at this time.
[Major Fielding] It would seem to me that... if we are to trust Captain Paxton... we must also trust his plan.
And since there is no one here with a better one to offer...
I suggest we back it with force.
What force?
The militia can't be used without breaking the treaty with Spain.
True enough, but volunteers can go.
Give me 300 men and the ships that carry them... and I promise you I'll smash Morgan's stronghold!
I'll get you volunteers to fight Morgan.
And Mr. Randolph will supply the ships... by requisition from the King's Crown... ready to sail for Tortuga tomorrow morning at sunrise.
I still don't like the sound of it... but I'll do my part, gentlemen.
Lady Margaret... you're keeping Sir Thomas waiting.
Thank you, Phoebe.
Montbars!
Here!
Quickly, shove off!
[Percy] Bart.!
We're all ready here.
Signal all the ships of the flotilla.
We sail at once.
[People Whooping] [Clapping] [Drumming Continues] [Whooping, Clapping Continue] [Chuckling] [Chuckling Continues] [Shouts] [Meg Whooping] [Whooping Continues] [Whooping Intensifies] Wait!
[Chuckling, Shouts] I'll remain here.
[Grunting] [Man] Aw, come on.!
Lady Margaret!
[Man Shouts] [Drumming Stops] [Whooping Stops] Lady Margaret... what's the meaning of this?
I knew your little game of playing lady would start to wear thin.
Don't ladies dance in Jamaica?
Not barefoot.
Your masquerade fooled Sir Thomas, but not me.
I suppose you are going to tell him the minute he docks.
That may not be necessary.
The flotilla won't return for at least three weeks... which should give you plenty of time to pack your things and be gone.
Ha!
You love him yourself.
That's how the wind blows, don't it?
If I thought you were really in love with Thomas...
I wouldn't raise a finger to stop the marriage.
But I saw how you looked at the long-legged sea captain.
Margaret, I know where your heart lies.
You'll be happier if you follow it.
Well, I was getting fedup playing the lady anyway.
Don't worry.
I know when the keg's run dry.
He's all yours, milady.
Margaret... if there's ever anything you need... Reggie, you'll take command of the flotilla.
Stay just out of range of the harbor cannon.
The rest of the force will land here... on the windward side of the island.
Open fire at dawn to cover the landing.
Right.
Broadsides at dawn.
What about this wall?
Won't they sight us?
I don't think so.
Anyway, the trees on that part of the island are thick enough to cover the landing party... until you're practically under the wall.
And might I ask what you will be doing all this time, Captain?
Blowing up the powder magazine.
The explosion will be your signal to attack.
Won't you need any men with you?
My chances will be better alone.
We'll swing the cannons tonight, Bonnet.
Aye, aye, sir.
Swing them tonight.
Tiny, make sure that all the crew are in the first wave, will you?
Gammel, see that the cutlass men stay with me.
Aye, aye, sir.
And my volunteers will cover the landing party.
Just as I told you, Sir Henry.
Your self-styled king of the ocean has brought all his friends.
Let them land.
Come on!
We're not here by invitation, you know!
Come on!
Come on!
Hurry up!
[Man] Hurry up, before Bart signals.
Step lively, men.
Got to reach the wall before Bart signals.
Come on.
Even it up.
Bonnet!
Aye, aye, sir.
Time to wake them up.
Give them a broadside.
Starboard guns, fire!
[Cannons Firing] [Cannons Continue] Well.
So far they've not seen us.
There's no sign of a man on the wall.
I don't like waiting like sitting ducks.
Sir Thomas, every moment we sit here lessons our chance of a surprise attack.
I say move now!
A friend of yours just arrived, Captain Morgan.
Only he used the back door.
All alone and heading for the arsenal.
How do you want him, alive or dead?
[Chuckling] Mr. Randolph here owes him several favors, I'm thinking.
Take him alive.
He deserves special attention.
Very good, Sir Henry.
You two, come on.
Very well.
Signal the attack.
[Cannons Firing] Randolph.
So this is Paxton's surprise.
The traitor has led us square into Morgan's trap.
I wished to God I could say you were wrong.
Randolph!
[Cannons Continue] Aha!
The king of the ocean shouldn't leave through a window like a common thief.
That fuse!
We've lost a lot of men, sir.
If that magazine doesn't blow up, we're finished.
I shouldn't trust that captain of yours.
I need some volunteers!
Command me, sir.
Good.
Get through if you can.
[Grunts] [Men Shouting] Fool!
Could've had a fortune in your grasp!
They're still alive.
Yes, side by side.
And that's the way they will hang.
[Chuckling] Two gallows.
Not very economical... seeing they'll only be using one.
I'll grant you one virtue, Morgan.
You have no fear of the rope.
I'll never end on their gallows.
Influence, that's what I've got... in higher places than this twopenny governor's palace.
The Crown still owes me a few favors for services rendered at Porto Bello and Panama.
And I've evened accounts with you.
By damning me at the trial... by denying Randolph was in your pay.
Well, I have the devil's luck, you see.
I'll cheat the hangman yet.
It would take more than the devil, Morgan.
It would take an angel to get either of us out of here.
I was told you had left the island.
Not the island, only the governor's palace.
But it's all for the best.
Lady Margaret... Meg... Don't say it.
I wasn't cut out to be a governor's lady... or any kind of lady, I guess.
The only real thing about me is this crest... and it wasn't my mother who wore it.
Why have you come back to tell me this?
It wasn't easy.
You were the only man who ever thought of me as a lady.
I'd like to have left you with that.
But my cradle was 100 gutters.
This crest belonged to Bart Paxton's mother, who was killed by Morgan.
So you see, Bart had more reason to fight them than to join them.
Perhaps Major Fielding's voice was so loud at the trial that it drowned out the truth... and my own better judgment.
I'll review the evidence at once.
I'll be going.
You're in love with Captain Paxton, aren't you?
Perhaps.
Meg, where will you go?
How will you live?
I'm an actress.
I'll get along.
Please, give this back to Captain Paxton.
Good-bye, Sir Thomas.
Jamaica will be losing a fine lady.
At your suggestion, I had Major Fielding search Randolph's house.
Where I found definite proof he was in Morgan's pay.
My judgment of you was too hasty, Captain.
My neck thanks you for reconsidering, Major.
But, Sir Thomas... how did you find out about my mother?
From a lady... who asked me to return this.
Stop, thief!
Stop, thief!
Stop!
She stole my purse!
Thief!
Stop, thief!
Stop, thief!
Stop!
She stole my purse!
Thief!
Let me go, you squid!
[Crowd Shouting] I warned you to sail clear of butchers and meat cleavers.
Bart!
My lady.
Man the yards!
Quick on all canvas!
Gather round, lads and lasses.
Gather round.
You've been shanghaied aboard for the last cruise of the Crimson Pirate... a long, long time ago in the far, far Caribbean.
Remember, in a pirate ship, in pirate waters, in a pirate world... ask no questions.
Believe only what you see.
No.
Believe half of what you see.
Man the capstan!
Up anchor!
Move, you lubbers!
Ship to starboard!
Attention!
A scurvy ship, Your Excellency.
You can tell by the position of the limbs.
Scurvy's killed the whole crew.
A trim little ship, Captain Rodrguez.
We'll take her in tow.
She'll bring a tidy sum.
Put an officer and two men aboard her, and have her in tow by nightfall.
Aye, aye, sir.
Only evil can come from a death ship.
Aye.
Sanctus, one of them touched me!
What happened to those two?
Follow me.
My humble apologies.
Bored?
If only there was something to break the monotony of this voyage.
Hands aloft, please.
You're the prisoners of Captain Vallo and his scurvy crew.
You may be overconfident, Captain Vallo.
Two hundred of the King's marines are aboard this vessel.
And only 20 pirates.
That puts the odds slightly in my favor.
Better surrender the ship.
I am merely a passenger.
Who is he?
Baron Gruda.
Special envoy to His Majesty.
Well, this is a pleasure.
You hanged most of my friends.
For murdering most of mine.
Seems you have only 199 marines now, Baron.
to surrender.
The Captain is not the type to...
However, if you'll permit me to speak to him... Ojo, pass the word for the Captain.
Bring down the Captain!
Send down the Captain!
Save the Captain!
Send down the Captain!
Did you ask for the Captain, sir?
Aye.
Pay him my compliments and show him in.
Gather round, lads.
Gather round.
We're in luck.
All hands will soon be digging into a fat divvy.
We're heading for the biggest and the best pirate days ever.
And here's the rich tally in round numbers.
"Muskets: 3,000.
"Powder kegs: 1,500.
"Rounds of musket shot: 65,000.
"Rounds of cannon shot..." Begging thy pardon for interrupting... but when will thee get into the gold?
Listen, fellows, listen.
There are islands in these waters steaming with rebellion against the King... and kept from boiling over only for lack of guns.
Islands where guns are worth more than gold.
More than diamonds.
Gunrunning?
But that's not piracy, Skipper.
That's business.
That means working ashore.
We're doing poorly enough afloat.
If we're going to try this new caper, let's make it a good one.
This cargo will bring 50,000 gold florin from any rebels worth the name.
50,000 florin?
That's a pretty good take.
Let's put it to the vote.
All those in favor...
If you'll forgive my interrupting, Skipper...
I'd like to think before I vote.
Meantime, we got regular pirate business to settle.
We got the plank, the culprit, and the verdict.
All we need's a trial and execution of a sentence.
He's guilty!
So much for the trial.
Now for execution.
Come on.
Kill me, you fools.
The King's Navy will scour the Seven Seas till every one of you is hung high and dry.
To the plank with him!
Avast!
There'll be no plank-walking for him.
Forgive my slow-wittedness, Skipper... but are thee asking us to spare this sweet-smelling toad?
Begging Thy Excellency's pardon.
Your captain's got more brains than all of you put together.
No doubt you intend to hold me for ransom.
No, my fine-feathered friend.
I'm setting you free.
I say, if there's no profit in the monkey we'll have our pleasure.
I say there is profit in him.
Alive.
How much profit?
Now hear me out.
I said 50,000 gold florin from the rebels for the guns... and here, by special commission, is the King's chief rebel-catcher.
So why not another 50,000 from him and his king... for telling them which rebels we sell all the guns to.
Eh, Baron?
A brilliant scheme, Captain.
My congratulations.
Thy congratulations.
If thou art for it, it is not for the good of pirates.
Good?
Gentlemen, it's magnificent.
I'm bound for the Island of Cobra to catch a man, El Libre, and smash his rebellion.
If you'll take the guns there, lure him out of his hole and into my hands...
I'll raise the purse another 50,000.
There it is, lads, in round figures: What do you say now, Mr. Humble Bellows?
Thy humble servant will believe it... when thy humble servant sees it.
I take it we have a deal, Captain.
This change of ship, Captain, most uncomfortable.
My men won't transfer cargo.
Too much like honest work.
Captain Vallo, your men have only left me headsail and topsail.
They're enough to get you to Cobra sooner or later.
My ship is faster than this barge.
I don't want you making port before I've got El Libre ready for delivery... or putting a shot in my backside.
I hope El Libre is not as careful as you are, Captain.
Cast off helm!
Cast off stern!
Mr. Bellows, make sail!
Aye, aye, sir!
Haul up, full and by.
Nor' nor' east.
We're heading for the Isle of Cobra.
Come on, you lubbers, move!
Hear ye, hear ye!
The King's vessel is now at anchor... in the port of Cobra with Baron Gruda aboard.
Any demonstration will be regarded as high treason.
The people seem very quiet, don't they?
I don't think they intend to demonstrate against Baron Gruda after all.
Apparently not, Governor.
What a pity.
Our troops could've cut them down like wheat.
Couldn't we shoot a few on general principles?
Might impress the Baron.
He might feel you are merely provoking trouble.
Most exasperating.
Fire the salute to Baron Gruda.
Attention!
Give the word and I'll dose those backstabbers with a broadside.
They're not firing at us, you powder-brained ape.
They're giving us a 15-gun salute.
We're flying the flag of Gruda.
Slimey, bring out the flags and run up that message I gave you.
And, Slimey, give the Governor my compliments.
The Crimson Pirate's?
No, you oyster-head, Baron Gruda's.
Mr. Bellows, keep the rest of these half-masted monkeys below deck.
Aye, aye, Skipper.
Keep a sharp lookout, lads.
I'll be back with El Libre tonight.
Let's go, Ojo.
There goes a good pirate, to sell his wares like a fish peddler.
Meaning no disrespect to the Skipper, of course.
Us with a price on our heads... holed, too, in one of His Majesty's ports like sitting ducks.
But if the Skipper pulls us through again, we'd be the ducks with the golden eggs.
You're thinking of geese, if you'll pardon the correction, Poison Paul.
Geese on a wild-goose chase.
What do they say, Joseph?
They've got the plague onboard, and they're quarantining themselves... until the victims are killed or cured.
We must signal my profound condolences to Baron Gruda.
Very well, Governor.
Maybe it's all for the best, Joseph.
El Libre's followers may yet show their hands... and give me a chance to impress the Baron.
Order my carriage.
Disperse the crowd.
Change the guard, and double your patrols in the street.
Come on, my popsy-wopsy-wopsies.
Plague, is it?
May it take all of them.
Baron Gruda first.
Aye, and if the plague don't, we will.
Who are you?
Simple fisher folk like yourselves.
Put in for a tankard of ale, a friendly word, and a chance to fight the King.
Why choose us?
You look and talk like a fighter.
It takes one to know one.
You may have us marked, all right.
Maybe not.
But we haven't marked you yet.
We're asking no questions.
We are.
What I've heard about El Libre is good enough for me.
Tell us how to contact him.
A man like him would be pleased to have two more strong-armed lads aboard.
Not very trusting souls, are they?
I guess we'll have to prove our high regard for El Libre.
Ojo, you took the words right out of my mouth.
A brawl with the King's men.
Let's go.
Left, right.
Left.
Mark time!
Right turn.
Halt!
Quick march!
Forward!
Halt!
Turn!
Right wheel!
March!
Halt!
Present arms!
Long live the republic!
Rebels!
Get them!
Long live El Libre!
After them!
There they are!
Don't let them get away!
Men!
Come on!
Come on!
Quick, in that corner.
There they go!
Hurry up.
In back.
This way!
Go ahead.
Pierce the canvas.
Fire!
Ready?
Fire!
Pick it up!
Lift it up!
Come on.
Lift it up!
Fire!
Take us away.
They're getting away!
Latch the cellars!
Block the alley!
Look out.
Soldiers.
Just a minute.
Search the place.
The stink would drive away a pig.
Which it did.
Watch that door.
You've saved us, lad, you've saved us.
We're among our own kind.
Rebels.
Wouldn't surprise me if you were El Libre himself.
You look like a born leader of men.
The name's Pablo Murphy.
And I got enough Irish from me father to know blarney when I hear it.
We'd have slit your throats for snooping spies by now... only for what you did to them soldiers.
Who are they?
Who knows?
This one can't talk and this one can't keep quiet.
All right, let's get to the point.
I'm Captain Vallo at your service.
And this is Lieutenant Ojo.
Vallo?
The pirate?
The Crimson Pirate?
That's right, sweet mother, with a bargain for El Libre... a shipload of powder shot and musketry.
Baron Gruda's ship.
Baron Gruda's ship?
Aye.
Baron Gruda's own 30-gunner.
We took her as easy as you'd take a mackerel, fine fishermen.
Easier.
For we used dead bait.
You killed Baron Gruda?
If I did that you wouldn't need the guns I want to sell you.
I'm a pirate, not a dog killer.
But I like you lads.
I like your style.
So gather round and get this: The Baron will arrive in port aboard my own ship in a matter of days.
So how about taking me to El Libre so we can close the deal for the guns?
Time and tide, you know.
Wash the stink off them and take them below.
Pass the word along.
When it's dark, we'll take them to the small boat... and row them out to their ship.
Come with me.
Now, you know what the plan is.
The rest will join my lads at the fishing boats... and stand by the pirate vessel to receive the guns.
Suppose the pirates refuse to give them up?
I'll keep my knife at Captain Vallo's throat.
Either he'll give the order to hand over the guns... or he'll never give another order.
You're cutting our throats, Pablo Murphy, not his.
I like your nerve, Pablo, but not your plan.
I say we've got to get the guns and take the palace before Baron Gruda gets here.
And I say we need more than guns.
We need El Libre to lead us.
You women won't face facts.
El Libre's been captured.
The way to face facts is to rescue him.
Rescue him?
From the King's prison?
lmpossible.
Not for a desperate man with a 30-gunner and a fighting crew.
A pirate rescue for El Libre?
That'd be taking him from the frying pan and throwing him into the fire.
We'll handle this our own way.
About face!
Get over here.
There's a meeting!
The door, quick!
Out!
The other door!
If I release you, can I count on your help?
You'll be well paid.
You misjudged our men.
Don't misjudge our women.
Another door here.
Where?
Follow me.
What's all the shooting?
The Skipper coming back from market.
I have a feeling we'll be putting out to sea.
Hoist anchor.
Man all canvas.
Look lively!
Man the yards!
Prepare to fire!
Fire one!
Fire two!
Signal Baron Gruda's ship for a broadside.
One of us can knock her out of the water.
Shore battery's asking for a broadside against them, Mr. Bellows.
What are you waiting for, drooling idiot?
Give 'em a broadside!
Aye, aye, sir!
One broadside coming up!
Good shooting, lads.
Well aimed.
Skipper, be that what thou bought at market?
Take the lady below and make her comfortable.
Thank you, Captain.
The gallant Captain Vallo, eh, lads?
Be that bit of fluff El Libre?
That's the bit of fluff that's taking us to him.
He's being held on the Island of San Perot, only a day's sailing from here.
Who's holding him for us, Skipper?
The King's troop.
In the military prison.
Now, what could be sweeter, lads?
We'll steal him from the King's men, and sell him back to a king's man.
But be thou seriously planning to...
Walk us into a king's prison?
Why, not at all, Humble Bellows, not at all.
Gather round, lads, gather round!
My, my, what a pretty knife.
Would you like a closer look?
Let's keep this pot looking like a ship of the line!
Come up here.
Hop to it!
I came up to talk about El Libre.
Go ahead.
I'm listening.
You have a plan to save him?
A plan and a price.
Guns alone will cost 50,000.
That's a great deal of money for guns.
How much are you asking for El Libre?
Oh, yes, El Libre.
I'll throw him in for nothing.
Very well, Captain.
I'll see that the money is arranged with him.
You may be sure that he'll honor the agreement.
What's your plan?
Why did you bolt your cabin door last night?
If you know it was bolted, you must've tried it.
And if you tried it, you know why it was bolted.
How do you propose to get El Libre?
Is your door open only to him?
What do you mean?
So much concern about one man can't be entirely political.
He's your lover.
No.
He's my father.
Captain!
Land ho!
On your feet, lads.
Attention!
You're supposed to be king's men, not bard slabs.
Look like you belong in those uniforms.
Ojo, signal to the garrison that Baron Gruda has arrived... to take El Libre into custody.
What about my father?
I ordered you to stay below.
What are they signaling?
The garrison commander wishes to give a dinner in honor of Baron Gruda.
What are we going to do?
We're going to accept, of course.
Baron Gruda and his bit of fluff... left enough clothes onboard to fool the King himself.
If anyone recognizes us... we'll be stripping for action and taking El Libre the hard way.
A fine body of men, Captain.
A fine body of men.
His Excellency Baron Gruda and party.
Welcome, Your Excellency.
It is a great honor for all of us to meet you at last.
It gives us great pleasure that you accept our hospitality.
On the contrary, my dear Colonel, it is I who am accepted.
Oh, no, Your Excellency.
I am the lucky one.
I had instructions from the Governor of Cobra to execute El Libre.
I was on the verge of doing so when I got your message.
The Governor is an idiot!
I may replace him... with a military man.
My dear Baron.
My dear Colonel.
May I introduce you to our guests?
By all means.
Your Excellency.
Your Excellency.
But I have so much trouble collecting the King's taxes here.
Tell me, Count.
How do the people pay at home?
Through the nose!
They pay through the nose!
That's really very good!
How long do we have to play this game?
Till the Colonel decides to hand over El Libre.
I am frightened.
The Count must be a constant delight to you.
He's really too funny for words.
Indeed he is.
Do tell us, Count.
What does the Queen wear when she goes out these days?
The Count always says the Queen wears the King out.
You are the wittiest man!
Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention, please.
To commemorate the honor Baron Gruda has done us by his visit... the officers of the Saint Theo garrison have arranged a little gift for him.
Will everyone come this way, please?
On the left... you have that great lover of democracy and the people, El Libre.
And on the right, that distinguished scientist...
Professor Prudence.
Both caught like rats in a trap... conspiring against the greater glory of His Majesty.
But thanks to statesmen like Baron Gruda... such men and such ideas will soon be destroyed.
As a distinguished scientist...
I can assure you an idea has no physical properties which can be destroyed.
As a lover of democracy and the people, I can assure you... both will survive your puny efforts.
As a statesman, I can assure you that no one can foretell the future.
However, your fate at present is as clear to me... as the face of this beautiful lady at my side.
Bravo!
Thank you, Your Excellency.
Yes.
She is very beautiful.
His Excellency has a point.
It's foolish to quarrel with fate when ours is so clearly in his hands.
Take them outside and hold them for Baron Gruda's pleasure.
My dear Colonel, thank you for a most rewarding evening.
And now we must go.
It is by no means over.
I've arranged a very special entertainment... for this very special occasion.
It's that dame we held for ransom.
Abandon ship.
Thank you, my dear Colonel.
Your Excellency!
But, my dear Baron!
Wonderful evening, Colonel.
Vallo!
But, Your Excellency.
Unexpected international affairs.
Happens to us diplomats all the time.
Put the prisoners in my carriage.
Aye, aye, sir.
I do hope the King will hear about this, Your Excellency.
Don't worry, he will.
Unclutch me, you polluted shrimp.
Stop him, you fools!
He's the Crimson Pirate!
The Crimson Pirate?
The Crimson Pirate!
Take the Colonel to safety.
Quick, man.
Take the Colonel to safety!
Let me go, you fools!
Don't worry, Colonel.
I'll take care of everything!
Citizen Ravel, save the Count!
Save the Count!
Sire!
Sire!
Good work, Captain.
Stop him!
There's the Crimson Pirate!
Captain!
The officers are mutinying.
Crush them!
Crush them!
Come on!
Sound the attack!
Hold the fort.
Don't give an inch.
Protect the women and children.
Reinforcements are on the way.
Lock the gates!
Let no one out.
Lock the gates!
Let no one out!
Long live the King!
I don't think we've met.
My name is Prudence.
Captain Vallo, at your service.
Thank you.
What are you grinning at?
So, I'm getting a halo.
You're afraid I'm getting soft.
Yeah, you're wrong.
It's just that this is a new kind of caper.
These people are getting on my nerves.
El Libre and his daughter are strictly business.
They haven't got me chained.
I've got them chained.
I'll be rid of them soon enough.
Tomorrow, I'm delivering them to Baron Gruda personally.
What are you talking about?
The girl?
What about the girl?
She's getting under my skin.
She's putting crazy ideas in my head.
She's unlocked my heart.
She's getting too close to me.
She's got me hooked.
She's blind.
I'm blind.
You're blind.
Who's blind?
Oh!
Love is blind.
I am not in love!
Avast there!
I told you not to make so much noise.
Now the Skipper will get her.
He always does.
Nobody will get her.
Untie the others.
Move!
What's up?
I'm having a little fun.
Come on, Skipper.
Let us have some fun.
You want her all to yourseluf?/u.
Why don't you join the fun?
Why don't you try yourseluf?/u.
You always tell that you couldn't make it.
Always work and no fun.
Mr. Bellows, take all three below and bring me the cabin keys.
If you'll forgive my pointing it out, Skipper... we can't leave a pretty woman unmolested aboard ship.
It will give piracy a bad name.
Are you challenging my orders?
I'd never do that, Skipper... but seeing thou is selling these pigeons to Baron Gruda anyway...
I thought there could be no harm to sport with them a bit first.
No offense, Skipper.
I'm putting you ashore tomorrow at Cobra and giving you the guns.
All of you.
Just don't thank me.
Skipper.
Yes, there's our ship.
With Baron Gruda waiting.
Won't he hate paying for El Libre... when he finds out we stole him out of one of the King's own prisons?
We'll heave to onto the point till nightfall.
Aye, aye, Skipper.
Slimey.
Let's see thee swim to yonder island.
Aye, and back again.
If my plan works, Baron Gruda himself will escort thee back.
I've a message for thee to give to him.
Do it, and when I am skipper... thou wilt be first mate.
Mr. Bellows... what about sharks?
They never attack a man.
Unless he attacks them first.
Governor.
Baron?
Send him to the kitchen and feed him.
Kitchen.
Feed him.
You'll have the 100,000 gold florin ready for them.
Whatever Your Excellency orders.
But this is sheer piracy.
I assure you...
I shall have El Libre, his daughter, his distinguished conspirator... our ship, our guns, the pirates, and Captain Vallo, without paying a sou.
Then why 100,000?
Have the money ready, I said.
The first mate thinks he can undo Vallo, but his plan may fail.
Even if we have to pay, such a haul would be cheap at double the price.
By the way...
I shall want a barrel of this, well drugged.
You disposed of Captain Vallo?
No.
It will be necessary to expose him to the crew first.
Which I'll be doing soon enough, if thou has followed my instructions.
To the letter.
And the money?
If you'll forgive my impatience.
It will be waiting for you in the morning.
Meanwhile, I place myself in your hands as security for it.
Very well.
But I remind thee, they be murderous hands when they're empty.
Hide His Excellency below.
As soon as it's clear topside, Ojo will stand by below with a small boat.
It's a short pull to shore.
Call your father.
Come with us.
Join us.
No.
But you want to.
I know you want to.
You're wrong.
There's nothing in it for me.
Get your father.
Then why are you setting us free?
I keep my promises, even foolish ones.
You made no promise.
You made a deal to sell us, and you can't do it.
All right, then.
I'm doing it for you.
Let's leave it at that.
No, Vallo.
We can't leave it at that.
You're a fighter.
Fight with us.
Fight for something decent.
Not I.
All my life I've watched injustice and dishonesty fly the flag of decency.
I don't trust them.
Don't you trust me?
Don't you trust what we have for each other?
What we have for each other we'll have to get over.
Can we?
You're right.
I won't let you go.
We belong together here, aboard my ship.
We'll find a way.
But that's not possible.
I can't stay here.
Don't you see?
Yes, I see.
And now, at last, you see it, too.
You've got your world, and I've got mine.
All right, gentlemen.
Sit down.
Professor, you'll go ashore later with Pablo Murphy and the guns.
Right.
Keep talking to yourself, loudly.
I want my men to think you're all still here.
That's no problem for me.
Now, remember, this is a dangerous game.
If my men tumble to it, they'll slit your throats, and mine, too.
I don't like it, Captain.
We can't leave you to face them alone.
Come with us.
Father... don't.
Avast!
Man the guns!
Topside, you swabs!
Help!
Not so fast, Skipper, if you'll pardon the intrusion.
You've sold me, Humble Bellows, and to a king's flunky.
Aye.
'Tis my modest opinion that no man can fly pirate's colors... who's not willing to sell his friend, his sweetheart, or his mother.
Well spoken, Mr. Bellows.
Foul spoken it is.
You've turned your hand against your Captain's back.
Yellow was never a pirate's color.
Nor rescuing a fair maiden a pirate caper.
Aye.
It's true.
I sailed beyond my depth... but only to sound out new waters for the lot of us.
If we'd have starved to death, I'd have never sold a man jack of you.
Gather round, lads.
This isn't the last of the pirate capers.
'Tis the last of thee and of thy capers... for 'twas put to the vote whilst thee was trying to deprive us of our loot.
Ye violated the pirate code by letting a fat fish off the hook.
By vote of all, ye are deprived of command... and sentenced under piratical law to be cast adrift in a small boat... without food or water.
A splendid decision, Mr. Bellows.
Quick justice and certain death.
Perhaps you'd save the King the expense of hanging this learned fool... and let him keep Captain Vallo company.
Thou hast a generous choice.
The gallows or the sea.
If it won't crowd you.
I'd rather you weren't coming, but I don't want to seem inhospitable.
As for thee... since I have no voice to raise against thy Captain's misdemeanors... thee will be pardoned by giving thy hand to thy new skipper.
What say thee?
Shall we loose thy bonds?
Cut him loose.
It's done, Skipper.
We set them adrift.
The morning tide will take them out to sea.
Wait!
This calls for a celebration, eh, Mr. Bellows?
I've a keg of rum aboard my boat.
Straight from the Governor's own cellar.
What say?
Aye.
I could use a drink.
Come on, lads!
Get the rum aboard.
Bring mine to the Captain's cabin.
There's the end of land.
The end of our world.
From now on, it's starve, thirst, and finally capsize.
I've been meditating on just that.
Capsizing is the solution of our problem.
There's no doubt about it.
lf you'll follow me, please.
Sit down, you fool!
Sit down, you...
It works.
Good old Aristotle.
Over 2,000 years ago, he wrote: "A metallic vessel will retain air underwater without filling."
But I myself have done some research on the subject... while designing a craft which I call an undersea boat.
How did you know this was airtight?
In science, my son... one knows nothing until one experiments.
We may now conclude that we are breathing.
Let us walk ashore as quickly as possible.
I compute there's sufficient air to last us several minutes.
Providing we don't waste our oxygen talking, of course.
All right, then.
Shut up!
Quite so.
You needn't have brought out the whole garrison.
I did the job myself.
They won't be so playful when they wake up this time.
All right.
Wake them up.
Sober them up and take them to the pirate ship.
Over the side with them!
Sorry I be for this, mates.
And I humbly apologize.
'Twould never have happened with Vallo as skipper.
He violated a pirate code and he had to go.
But he went like a pirate.
We're going like fish.
I can't forgive myself for that.
King's flunky made a monkey of Humble Bellows.
Pirate of the old school.
Enough of that!
Hoist them!
Put a crew aboard this ship and have her re-canvased.
I want her ready to sail when I leave.
Give them just enough bread and water to keep them alive.
They'll fetch a good bounty from the King.
Ahoy.
Pablo Murphy.
Well, I'll be... Get us out of these chains.
After all you got us into, you lying blabbermouth?
Get yourself out of it.
Pablo Murphy.
For the last time, get away from us.
Get it through that head of yours, I didn't sell El Libre.
Let me assure... We can see for ourselves what he's done.
If we'd gone my way, El Libre wouldn't be dead.
Consuelo wouldn't be held captive in the palace... and we'd have guns to stop Gruda's men from crushing us.
Hold it, gentlemen.
Soldiers.
By order of Baron Gruda, all fishing will be done under armed escort.
The entire catch to be turned over to the Governor.
What'll be left for us?
The bait.
In that case, we'll do no fishing.
Any more objections?
The rest of you proceed to the Governor's dock.
Get moving!
Take him to the fortress.
This way.
Hey, there, back in line.
Follow those boats.
After them!
Let's go.
Is everything arranged?
Just as you ordered, Excellency.
You've broken the back of the rebellion overnight.
The King owes you much.
He will pay it.
I may even be able to collect the full bounty on Captain Vallo... for he was killed by his own men while trying to save El Libre.
Don't be upset, my dear.
You'll form new attachments here.
You're to marry the Governor.
After I'm gone, you'll rule through her, Governor.
You'll order your people to till their fields and fish their seas... for the greater glory of the King.
I'd die first.
No, you'll die last.
First you'll watch your people go one by one.
Someday I'll kill you.
Officer!
These methods will bring her round soon.
I shouldn't like her to kill herself before she marries.
She's not the type.
She'll marry you and wait for a chance to poison you.
It doesn't sound like an ideal marriage.
Couldn't we dispense with that?
Too much of it upsets my liver.
It's not your liver.
It's your heart.
It's much too soft.
Tonight the people bury El Libre.
I want a proclamation posted in the path of the funeral procession... announcing your marriage to the daughter of El Libre.
Excellency!
People will be required to attend and provide entertainment... to make it a day of rejoicing.
We'll have them fill the royal grain warehouse... with 10,000 sacks of grain as a present.
You're learning fast.
After the ceremony, I'll leave you my troops and my blessings, and depart.
Except for the late, lamented Vallo, this has been a most boring assignment.
On your way, pig!
Amnesty has been declared for all prisoners.
Baron Gruda will give you a chance to show allegiance at the wedding.
Gruda.
Gruda, someday I'll kill you.
I'll kill you!
So it's a marriage now, is it?
Consuelo will never do it.
Look!
10,000 sacks of grain for the Governor.
Not mine!
So we're to rejoice, are we?
Baron Gruda has made the defacing of public property... an offense punishable by death... both for the culprit and the accomplices.
Sergeant, round up these people.
What are you going to do about it?
It's no concern of mine.
What are you going to do about her?
Get her out of it, somehow.
Alone, against 1,000 troops?
There must be a way.
There is.
It's a question of simple logic.
We need allies.
These people need freedom.
Let's help them get it.
The only freedom I'm interested in is Consuelo's.
She'll never consent to be free until her people are free.
Impossible.
They don't have a chance against Gruda's crack troops.
Science has learned that nothing is impossible.
Not long ago, I saw a ship sailing through the skies of France... supported by a great bag filled with air that was lighter than air.
A friend of mine has invented a liquid that can blast away mountains.
I have completed plans for a boat that can sail underneath the water.
Who knows what we may accomplish... against the outdated Baron Gruda and his outdated world?
All we need is the help of these people... a little imagination, and deft fingers with which to steal a few basic materials.
The Baron thinks we're finished.
We're going to let him go on thinking so.
We'll fill the royal grain warehouse as ordered.
But with the seeds of the Professor's genius.
I beg your pardon?
The Baron has the most weapons.
But we'll have the newest.
An explosive that moves mountains.
A ship that flies through the air.
A ship that flies through the air by next Sunday?
lmpossible.
A great man once said to me: "Science has learned that nothing is impossible."
Gather round, lads and lasses.
We'll show your fighters and workers new ways to get rid of old enemies.
It doesn't smell right.
into the warehouse.
The tunnel to smuggle them out is complete.
The island is making headway with the modern weapons to smuggle in... and still you stand and stir... that stew with no result.
My friend sent me no formula to go on... simply the ingredients.
Principally nitrogen and glycerin.
Anyway, I'm not really sure I want to discover it.
If it can remove a mountain, how do I know it won't remove an island?
"In science, one knows nothing unless one experiments."
I wish you'd stop quoting me.
That's it.
Soldiers!
Don't fall down with that.
Even if they shoot you.
Be careful you don't over-inflate this in the morning.
We've cut the wall braces to the breaking point.
But we don't want them to collapse before the signal.
Remember... there'll be no signal given till Consuelo's gotten safely away from Baron Gruda.
Careful.
The liquid explosive.
Is that all that's left?
I've improved a bit on the formula.
This is concentrated 1,000 times.
Please.
The royal grain warehouse is reported full to capacity, Your Excellency.
Amazing how you brought them to their knees.
Spare the rod and spoil the child.
Never forget that, my dear Governor.
Let's get on with the wedding ceremony.
First, a floral offering for the bride from the unmarried girls of the island.
A local custom for celebrating weddings.
Proceed.
Music.
Watch it.
Your beard is showing.
Here we go.
These peasant shapes are not to my taste.
Death to Gruda!
Kill them!
Port side battery.
Fire!
No, I mean left.
Left!
No.
Right.
No, left a bit.
What's the matter with you?
Don't you know where you're going?
Fire!
We're going after the girl.
Let's strip for action.
Halt!
We'll cut her to pieces.
Man your cannons.
Come on, now.
The high explosive.
Quick.
Get underway!
Aye, aye, sir.
Man the capstan!
Get her below.
Don't waste time.
Slit the cable!
We've got to gain altitude.
Unload the ballast.
Come on.
Get rid of something.
What is it?
It is the wrath of heaven!
It has destroyed the fortress!
Our ship and our lads.
We're heading straight for them.
Make it close.
But not too close.
We'll need our ship and our lads to catch Gruda.
They're going to blow us up!
Jump for your lives!
It's our own skipper!
We knew you'd come.
Get us off this ship.
Cut the rope down.
Get us out of here!
Pack out all canvas, you fairy-tale sea snakes!
Go get 'em!
Move them!
Move!
I really think he plans to do battle with us.
Captain Vallo's lost his head as well as his heart.
Haul that jib.
Trim those top gallows.
Two points starboard.
Hold your fire for a broadside.
Shall we fire?
There'll be no firing with the girl on the ship.
We're going to board her.
Below decks, the lot of you.
On the double.
Coming, Mr. Bellows?
The fools are going to trade broadsides with us.
In you go.
With nobody at the wheel to steer, we'll not get alongside.
Too late to worry about it.
We'll have to take our chances.
As ye wish.
We'll go.
My humble apologies.
But if I can't live like a pirate, I'll die like one.
I'll stand by the wheel and bring her alongside.
Skipper!
Do them the dirty!
Stand by to fire!
Fire!
We're lost!
Get the girl!
Hold it, Professor!
We've won!
Get rid of that stuff.
English
Is everything to your liking, ma'am?
It's an unusually cheerful spectacle, Captain Martos.
When we're becalmed like this, we might as well enjoy ourselves.
When I arrive in New Orleans I shall enjoy myself, but not until then.
That pirate, Baptiste, is an obsession with her.
Every strange sail we sight calls for a fresh bottle of smelling salts.
Why, ma'am, you couldn't be safer if you were in your own drawing room.
In a calm like this, no pirate could ever get to us.
Not even Baptiste.
Fetch me that fiddler, Tom.
He's better than the one we got.
Aye, aye, sir.
Four bells and all's well!
Pirates!
Pirates!
Baptiste!
Mr. Roberts, you guard the ladies.
You men, arm yourselves and get on deck!
Well, thank you, son.
Thank you, son.
Don't let them forget that China silk, Tom.
Aye.
And did you fetch along the fiddler?
He went with the spice bales.
What do you intend to do with us, pirate?
Set you adrift in the small boats, along with the passengers.
Unless there's any amongst you who would volunteer?
Think you any of my men would serve with you?
Well, not a lad amongst us hasn't served on a vessel of Alexander Narbonne.
Tell that to your master, if your small boat's lucky enough to be picked up.
At the same time I'll request the privilege of being present when Narbonne has you hanged from your own yardarm.
Why bother Narbonne?
I'll invite you myself.
Now, how many men would rather transfer registry than hit the small boats?
Small boats always make me crazy.
I'll take the skull and bones.
So will I.
Wise lads, Captain.
Here be one we missed.
Better drag him in.
Easy with them powder casks.
Aye, aye, sir!
Strip her rigging clean.
Aye, aye, sir!
Seems like we're all through.
Scuttler, weigh below and make sure she settles fast.
Here's something we found.
Well, a cabin boy, eh?
Well, son, would you like to sign on with Frederic Baptiste?
Speak up, can't you... Well, lower me jib a bustle.
Very nice to meet you.
Is this new gear on all the Narbonne craft?
How did you get aboard?
It was easy.
But if I'd known you were going to get your moldy old ship captured by a gang of cutthroats, I'd have stayed in Boston.
Stowaway, eh?
Put her in the boat with the other women.
Pulled away.
Then she'll have to go in the longboat with them.
And get going before I change my mind and make you swim back to New Orleans.
Come on, you...
Wait a minute.
I've got two dresses in that boat and I'm not leaving without them.
You know, he's making a big mistake putting one woman in with all those men.
You wouldn't be thinking... That she'd be safer with us?
Precisely.
Oh, no, you don't.
It's all for your safety... No, you don't.
Let me down, you big ape!
You near scratched my ear off.
Good.
You just don't know how to handle a lady.
See what I mean?
If you don't put me down...
Imagine all those poor defenseless men alone in a small boat with a dangerous female like this?
Here, take her.
When I get down in the boat, hand her to me.
You just don't know how to handle a lady.
Ouch!
Quiet.
Help me, Kryl.
Help me.
Keep her quiet now.
You near bit me ear off!
Ow!
Take her, Kryl!
Take her!
You little devil, you... You think my hand's a blooming sea biscuit?
Touch me again and I'll bite your arm off.
We gotta get her below decks before the other boats get back.
You and your wonderful idea.
We should've dumped her overboard.
Ow!
Ow!
Quiet!
Whatever you have up there, bring it down here.
Ow!
What goes on out there?
Let me down.
Let me down.
By the Dog Star!
A female.
I've been kidnapped!
And I demand that you do something about it.
She was stowed away aboard the Gulf Queen, sir.
But somehow she got herself in our boat, sir.
I'll discuss that with you later.
Meanwhile, leave her here.
Aye, aye, sir.
With the greatest of pleasure.
Turn around.
Who are you?
The captain of this vessel.
But I thought... Then who was the other?
Jared?
My mate.
Fortunately, many people make the same mistake.
Then you must be... Frederic Baptiste, the bloodthirsty pirate, the scourge of the Mexican government, that fiend in human shape.
At your service, mademoiselle.
Up to a point.
Somebody's been exaggerating.
Oh?
Or maybe they haven't.
Look what your men have done to me.
You'll find ointment in that chest, Miss... Deborah McCoy.
Debbie, they call me.
Where were you headed, Debbie?
Oh, New Orleans, Rio.
I wasn't sure.
To visit?
No.
They say that they're good places for a girl to earn her living.
And this living, how did you propose to make it?
I'm an entertainer.
I sing a little and I dance a little.
You know, you combine all the elements of a first-class problem.
Why?
All you have to do is put me ashore somewhere.
And stretch my neck by doing it?
I know how to keep a tight mouth.
After all, they say you only attack the ships of Alexander Narbonne.
I don't even know who he is.
The richest man in New Orleans.
Or used to be.
Oh.
He'd be a good one to know, wouldn't he?
That depends on one's point of view.
Why do you give his ships your special attention?
That's my point of view.
Tell me, how long have you been making your own way, Debbie?
Too long.
No one to help you?
Too many.
I still can't decide what to do about you.
The sailors were given a chance to sign on with you.
I believe I have a more practical solution than that.
I knew you'd think of something.
We'll maroon you on a sand spit.
Oh.
I'm sure you can think of something better than that.
Why, no.
It's a perfect way to handle the situation.
We'll pick a sand spit on the sea lanes to South America.
If you're picked up, you'll get to Rio.
And if not, you'll be on a clean white beach protected by palm trees.
You'll soon grow to love it.
Finished, captain.
We stripped her clean.
Cargo aboard and stowed.
Not a bad haul for a ship her size.
Oh.
These must be worth a fortune.
I thought I ordered you set adrift.
Oh, you did, but somehow the orders got mixed up.
You'd better find a cabin for our passenger.
A cabin?
Anything will do.
She'll only be with us until we sight a suitable sand spit.
But I thought... Good night, Debbie.
Sleep as well as you can.
Away with you.
Another four days and that girl will have them wearing lace on their drawers.
Yeah, that's a fair shame, sir.
It's always been me pride we had the roughest and dirtiest crew in the Mexican gulf.
I can't stand to look at it anymore.
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
Where did you get that dress?
Oh, this?
It's just a little old thing Jared rummaged for me in a chest.
Jared, eh?
So he rummaged it for you in a chest, did he?
Well, take it off.
Oh, were you taking it to someone?
How awful of Jared not to tell me.
But, after all, she won't know, will she?
I will.
But you'll forget.
You'll forget about me and the dress, these last few days, everything.
At least I'll try.
While I sit on my sand spit and remember.
I told you to take that dress off.
All right.
You needn't shout.
Not here.
Now look what you've done to the hem.
Afternoon, Miss Debbie.
Good afternoon, Bertram.
He's been telling me about his sister.
I remind him of her.
He never had a sister.
Oh, the poor fellow.
He's had such a sad life.
He's had the kind of life he wants.
So have I.
Up to now.
Jared!
Now, you mustn't be angry with Jared.
Miss McCoy, you've teased and wheedled everybody aboard this ship.
You've shot all discipline to shreds and now you tell me how to treat my crew.
It's time I put a stop to it.
You'd be wanting to see me, sir?
Cram on full sail.
I mean to be in and out of New Orleans before dawn.
Aye, aye, sir.
Oh, I hate to think of your running such a risk just to take me where I want to go.
You're not going ashore.
I am.
And the moment I get back we head for the Tortugas, where you'll stay and no doubt do very well.
Now, go to your cabin and stay there.
And take off that dress!
Keep her steady.
More gray hairs for Narbonne.
It's a pity you won't be there in the morning to see them sprout.
He'll be bald before I'm through.
Jared, if there's any trouble with that girl, I'll hold you responsible.
Oh, you needn't fret about her, sir.
She's locked in the cabin.
I have the key right here in my pocket.
Well, I'd better put it in my pocket.
Then I know she won't cause any trouble.
Aye, aye, sir.
Cast off.
Good morning, Mama.
It's a beautiful morning, isn't it?
So it's a beautiful morning.
What about it?
You look tired, Mama.
Go inside and rest.
We have no time to rest.
The customers are already in the market.
We gotta put the rest of the vegetables on... No, no, no, Mama.
Later.
Out of my way.
I was wondering when I...
Sorry, but you should have let me out.
So this is where you keep her.
Mama, I swear, I never saw her before.
After 20 years, you keep a woman in the vegetable box.
It isn't true!
After 20 years, I didn't!
I never saw your husband before in my life.
I slept in there last night because I had no place else to go.
Liar.
Mama.
Hag.
No, no, no, please.
Mama... Police!
Police!
Please, Mama, don't.
Joseph, hadn't you better go?
If Madame Brizar will pardon me.
Of course.
Police!
Police!
Police!
Please, Mama!
I wouldn't have your husband on a salad with mayonnaise!
He's good enough for me, but he's not good enough for you?
Police!
Mama!
You know what?
If he's so good you can have him.
Please stop screaming for me.
I'm here.
Now what is the cause for this disturbance?
He hid her in our vegetable closet.
I never saw her before.
He lies.
With my own eyes I saw her.
For 20 years, she accuses me of flirting with every woman who comes to buy vegetables!
Because it took me 20 years to catch him!
Believe me, Mr. Policeman.
I didn't do anything.
I open the closet door and there she is!
Silence!
I can't hear you for the shouting.
Go inside.
The rest of you, disperse.
Madame Brizar's compliments, mademoiselle.
She wants to see you.
Look, I'm in a hurry, and I'm in trouble enough.
Then you should want to see Madame Brizar.
This way, please.
Madame Brizar.
Did you want to see me?
Yes.
You could be very attractive, my girl.
What's your name?
Deborah McCoy.
Stand back a little, so that I can see you better.
Hmm.
Not too bad.
Not too bad.
There she is!
By the carriage!
Get in, Deborah.
Why?
Because that policeman is looking for you.
Now drive on.
Do you mind if I ask a question?
By all means.
Where are we going?
Home.
Come, come, child.
In we go.
You may put the carriage away.
Yes, madame.
Come, Deborah.
Good morning, Toussaint.
Good morning, ma'am.
Monsieur Narbonne and Monsieur Patout are waiting.
Oh.
At this early hour?
Well, don't stand there and gawk.
Come in, darling.
Sit down, child, sit down.
Monsieur Narbonne.
Such an honor.
Good morning, madame.
I'm giving a soire for the Governor and his wife tonight, and Patout has just reminded me that we have no entertainers.
You remember my secretary?
Certainly I remember Monsieur Patout.
He always brings the check.
No doubt.
There was a light-haired girl last time who was unusually pretty, if a bit gauche.
What was her name, Patout?
Cleo, sir.
Ah, yes, one of my loveliest girls.
Very lovely, despite her unfortunate habit of singing off-key.
Oh, that has been overcome, Monsieur Narbonne.
She no longer sings.
She dances.
Splendid.
Then send her along, by all means.
Well, and who is this?
Somebody who should not be here.
Now, make your curtsy, child, and run along.
Go on, run along.
So you're Monsieur Narbonne?
Well, hello.
Hello.
I've heard a lot about you from mutual friends.
Really?
How nice.
Come, Patout.
9:00 this evening, Madame Brizar.
You can leave everything to me, as usual.
I'll send you a shower of talent and beauty.
"Hello," she says.
"Hello," she says.
Haven't you even the slightest training?
So far I've always done all right.
I've never been so mortified.
Perhaps I've made a serious mistake.
Perhaps you have.
And then again, maybe I'm the one who's made the mistake.
"Hello," she says.
Hmm!
Oh, Toussaint.
Yes, ma'am.
Will you tell Delphine and Cleo that I wish to see them?
Yes, ma'am.
I'll tell them.
And don't stoop.
Your posture's most unbecoming.
What's the matter with my posture?
Oh, it fails utterly to suggest the languid grace of the swan, or the more piquant movements of the male partridge.
Huh?
Good morning, madame.
You wanted to see us?
Another affair at Monsieur Narbonne's.
Delphine, you will wear the white lace.
But it makes me look so young.
Well, that's what we have in mind, darling.
And, Cleo, you will wear the black dress and look your best tonight.
Monsieur Narbonne expressed some interest in you.
It worked.
I told you, if I sang off-key, he'd notice me.
Is he really the richest man in New Orleans?
He's not only very rich, he's very single.
Oh, Delphine, Cleo.
This is Deborah McCoy, who may stay with us.
Now, after I've had my coffee, we'll discuss your qualifications, and then I'll decide.
Oh, Toussaint?
Toussaint, my coffee in the study, please.
She can take her time over that coffee.
I've decided for her.
What a lot of time I've wasted living in Boston.
Higher, higher, much higher.
Higher all around.
Much higher.
This is for the Seamen's Fund brawl next Tuesday night at the Catfish.
Will Monsieur Narbonne be there?
Monsieur never goes to brawls.
When do I get to go where he goes?
Well, after you've had the rough edges knocked off.
Another month and you might be ready for a gentleman's party.
A man is no different because of his clothes.
Gentlemen prefer another type of girl.
A slouchier, more indifferent type.
Practice looking slouchy and indifferent.
After your song, there will of course be applause, and then, no doubt, you will be summoned to the table of your host, Captain Kingston.
Now, I will be Captain Kingston.
Good evening, Captain.
How about buying me a drink?
No.
No.
No.
No.
The approach is much too abrupt.
Well, it always worked before.
Well, maybe, in your prosaic Boston, but here in New Orleans, the gentlemen prefer a more roundabout course.
Especially Captain Kingston.
He's a great favorite with our first families.
That guarantees he'll be a first-class bore.
Debbie, Captain Kingston, as head of the Seamen's Fund, gives these parties to entertain his seafaring friends, not to entertain you.
Now, you are Captain Kingston.
Observe me.
Ah, Captain.
The city has been desolate while you were away.
Fetch me a beer, wench.
The Captain only drinks champagne.
And remember, we get an extra five percent from the management of the Catfish.
I still think you're making a mistake sending me to a fish fry.
My talents belong in the drawing room.
Ridiculous, child.
You can't fly until you've walked.
Tonight, you will attend the party at the Catfish with the other girls.
Now, once more.
Captain Kingston.
And did you have an interesting trip?
Interesting enough.
Except for a brush with the pirate Baptiste.
No, no.
You must never mention anything unpleasant.
Unpleasant?
The very name of that monster must be avoided when talking with seafaring men, especially Captain Kingston.
He is a privateer commissioned to catch pirates.
Confine your conversation to subjects that are soothing.
I wonder why I am so sure I am going to dislike Captain Kingston.
No, don't start that again.
Besides, you've got to rehearse your song again.
Come along.
Back to work.
Back to the piano.
Now, from the beginning.
Are you ready?
One, two, three.
You near bit me ear off.
I only wanted you to share a bottle with me.
Oh?
Here.
Now you have one all to yourself.
Stop that.
Stop that.
Tonight everybody in my place is supposed to be friendly.
That's just it.
He's too friendly.
I may even report this to Madame Brizar.
Oh, so you're the singer?
I was.
In this air, I don't know.
Well, you'll get used to it.
Besides, you're late.
Why didn't you come with the other girls?
No doubt she had something better to do.
Good evening.
What are you doing here?
That's a fine question, hey, Captain Kingston?
Asking the host what he's doing in his own party.
Captain Kingston?
At your service, mademoiselle.
Up to a point.
So now you're here in New Orleans to entertain us?
Yes.
Oh, it's such an honor you have conferred.
I am so gratified to be at your party, pirate.
Careful.
The city has been absolutely desolate while you were away.
Debbie, will you please remember my neck?
Oh, I shall remember it.
Every moment while I'm singing.
You won't go away, will you?
Hardly.
We have so much in common.
So many things to discuss, uh, Captain Kingston.
Gentlemen, attention, please.
We're about to be entertained by a charming young lady, who I'm sure will capture you, as she has captured me.
It gives me great pleasure to introduce to you Mademoiselle...
I do not believe I know your name, mademoiselle.
Take a chance.
The first name you think of.
Ah, yes, my friends, Mademoiselle Deborah McCoy.
One good look and you can tell That I was brought up very well An education gives a girl a certain air As the French would say, savoir-faire You want a song I have the words for it Something light and gay, monsieur You want a dance I have the steps for it Anything you say, monsieur I've even learned how to say "no, no" As every lady should Yes, everything I've learned to do Oui, oui, I've learned to do good You want my heart You're just the man for it I'm the girl for you, I'm sure If you want my song If you want my dance If you want my heart You will have the chance Monsieur, monsieur Oh, you have but to say the word You want a kiss I have the lips for it If you'd care to try, monsieur You want my love I have the arms for it That's the reason why, monsieur Since I was young I was always taught A lady must obey So everything I'm told to do, I do Oui, oui, s'il vous plat You have a ring I've got the place for it And you know the place, I'm sure If you want my lips If you want my arms I will take the ring You can have my charms Monsieur, monsieur You have but to say the word Charming.
You would've been wasted in the Tortugas.
You're very kind, sir, but it's no thanks to you that I'm not there now.
Just to satisfy my curiosity, how did you get here?
There are a few questions I'd like to ask you, Captain, just to satisfy my curiosity.
Then I'll strike a bargain with you.
You ignore my questions and I'll ignore yours.
If these people only knew that the great Captain Kingston was really a...
I think it unlikely they will ever know, unless you tell them.
But the danger, especially with a price on your head...
Exists only if, by an odd coincidence, somebody who'd been aboard my ship should turn up in New Orleans.
And in that event?
I would use every means to protect myself.
As you all know, our Seamen's Fund came into being some years ago when shipping in New Orleans was at a standstill and our seamen were hungry and jobless.
Virtually every New Orleans shipowner was ruined by the barbarous acts of piracy of that infamous cutthroat, Baptiste!
Any ship not destroyed by Baptiste was bought by Alexander Narbonne, who soon controlled all the shipping in these Gulf waters.
Unfortunately for us, Monsieur Narbonne chose to man his fleet with crews from other ports.
At this time, when our situation seemed hopeless, a friend and benefactor came to our aid, Captain Kingston.
Close your mouth, Debbie.
Ye be a friend of the Captain's, be n't ye?
I be.
Then why sit alone?
Come on and join some more of his friends.
My friends, you're all familiar with the terms of my father's will, directing that certain investments be made for the benefit of the Seamen's Fund.
Once more I bring you good news.
During the past six months these investments have shown substantial profits.
Tonight the Seamen's Fund is in a position to outfit three more ships, for captains whose vessels were destroyed by the pirate Baptiste.
The gold for this purpose will be turned over to the Seamen's Fund tomorrow morning.
To your health, Captain.
Thank you.
And now you are to entertain me.
Very well.
Do we sing, dance or fight?
We decide on the way home.
I be just telling the little lady all about ye.
Yes.
He was telling me that if anyone could catch Baptiste, you could.
Heaven knows, I try hard enough, but he constantly seems to elude me.
Why don't you try standing still for a while?
You might catch him.
He's on his way out.
Be ready.
Orlande?
Whip up, Orlande.
No, you don't!
Not a sound out of you.
Hurry up with it!
Ow!
Run for it!
Are you all right?
Thanks to your teeth.
I seem to recall they're very sharp.
Who were those men?
I don't know.
But I know what they were after.
My ring, and they got it.
But I doubt if it'll make the new owner very happy when he gets it.
Well, you're hurt.
You'd better get to a doctor at once.
Oh, it's nothing serious.
Debbie, you're out very late, and apparently in very bad company.
Good work, Orlande.
And now to Madame Brizar's.
Yes, sir.
Giddap.
Easy there.
Those are the first words you've said all evening that make any sense.
Why, Debbie, I thought I'd made everything very clear.
You certainly did.
As Baptiste you sink ships.
Then as Kingston you turn the proceeds into a fund to outfit ships for people whose ships have been sunk by Baptiste.
Very clear.
It does sounds a little complicated.
Suppose we put it this way.
Some people need help, so I help them.
And in doing it, I right some old wrongs.
But what if they should catch you?
Then I should be very sorry.
New Orleans is such a lovely place, and the ladies in it even lovelier.
By the way, Debbie, if you were a man wanted by the authorities, and the secret of your identity rested with a certain girl, would you continue to worry about it?
I'd say the girl was the least of my worries.
The others I'm sure I can handle.
Good night, Debbie.
Well?
There's no doubt about it.
It's the ring you gave Baptiste.
Your initials are on the inside.
So now we've finished guessing.
The real Baptiste is dead.
And Kingston must have killed him.
What a pity.
And more the pity he didn't die quickly before talking.
Without the ring, Kingston can prove nothing.
I wish I could be sure of that.
He flaunted this ring before me in my own house.
Whether to inform me that he had more evidence, or merely to worry me that he might have, I don't know.
If he had more evidence, he's had ample time to present it to the Governor.
Unfortunately, he's much cleverer than you.
I used the real Baptiste to eliminate the competition of Kingston's father and the other shipowners.
So now Kingston turns pirate, calls himself Baptiste, and employs the same method against me.
Eight of my ships sunk, and eight others outfitted.
It's no wonder he prefers the present situation.
If it continues much longer, he will have destroyed you completely.
Unless we destroy him first, at sea where he should be destroyed.
You know, Patout, I rather fancy being a hero, ridding the seas of this new Baptiste.
Well?
Do you approve?
Not bad.
Not bad.
A few minor corrections, and not bad at all.
A little too much rouge, perhaps.
Monsieur Narbonne prefers a pale appearance.
It's not rouge, and I don't intend to stick my face in a flour barrel just to please Monsieur Narbonne.
Debbie, please remember, when I found you, you had your face in a vegetable bin.
Ever since you've been here I've heard nothing but "When do I entertain at Monsieur Narbonne's?"
Now the time is here, Monsieur Patout has made a point of asking for your presence, you're suddenly very nonchalant about the most eligible bachelor in New Orleans.
Oh, not at all.
I couldn't be more interested.
Then you might show it.
Oh, to me, of course, not to him.
Any more instructions?
Yes.
Stay away from the ladies, sing your song, retire to your dressing room... And be particularly pleasant to that little worm, Monsieur Patout.
By all means.
He's very close to Monsieur Narbonne.
And he can stay there.
I intend to stay close to Captain Kingston.
Oh.
Good evening.
Good evening.
I'm from Madame Brizar's.
Oh.
This way please.
This should convince you of what you're missing, Captain.
There's nothing like it at sea.
Fortunately for my crew.
You can't be that thirsty, Captain.
Debbie, what a pleasant surprise.
That makes us even.
I was surprised when I heard you were going to be here.
Why, I wouldn't miss one of Narbonne's soires for all his ships at sea.
Darling, you'd better come here and defend yourself.
Patout's complaining to Uncle again.
Pardon me, Debbie.
A summons from His Excellency, the Governor.
We will all be looking forward to hearing you sing.
Mademoiselle, the entertainers wait in another room.
I meant no offense, Captain.
It's just that I'm so concerned about Monsieur Narbonne and the losses he has suffered.
A familiar complaint, Robert.
Why haven't you hung Baptiste?
Ah, Your Excellency, the ocean is vast, the sea lanes many.
Where he is, I am not.
Where I am, he is not.
But someday we shall meet.
In the meantime, Patout here is worried.
It seems that one of Narbonne's ships is leaving Spain next week with a very rich cargo, and he fears... Forgive me, your Excellency, but I meant that information to be kept in confidence.
If word should get out... Well, Baptiste's ear seems to be in as many places as his ship.
Of course, Patout, I understand.
Rest assured, it will go no further.
Not a soul will hear it from my lips.
Enough of Baptiste.
Let's speak of something pleasant.
I'll arrange for the entertainment to begin.
I noticed you recognized our singer.
Ah, yes.
And I can recommend her very highly.
Oh, so that's who the young lady was.
For a moment I was almost jealous.
Delightful evening, Monsieur Narbonne.
It's always a pleasure to see you, madame.
It worked like a charm, even better than we'd hoped.
Oh?
The Governor himself told him about our ship from Spain and I pretended that the Governor had breached a confidence.
Splendid.
Splendid.
In that case, Patout, I think we can feel secure that our three ships from Paris will arrive safely in New Orleans.
Has our entertainer arrived yet?
Yes, and Captain Kingston seemed quite pleased to see her, which Mademoiselle Villon noticed.
Good.
Perhaps tonight we will kill one bird with two stones.
Fetch the singer.
Good evening.
Good evening, monsieur.
Ah, Mademoiselle Villon.
We see far too little of you when the Captain is away.
And the Captain is away far too often.
I'll take that as a compliment, Arlene.
Or is it a warning, Kingston?
Remember, a fiance is not yet a wife.
How very discerning, monsieur.
And, Robert, how very true.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is Monsieur Narbonne's pleasure to present a singer who comes highly recommended.
Mademoiselle McCoy.
I trust this girl can carry an air.
Robert assures me she's quite good.
There's a song in the air And you know why it's there Because you're in love You're in love And that's how you know it For you took the world for granted Now you know that the world's enchanted And life was... What did you do then?
I sent him home, of course.
There's a cloud in the sky But it's passing you by And the sky looks blue Dreams come true Just because he's in love With you So there I was, without a servant in the house and the General calling.
Such a predicament.
Yes, Robert?
Because you're in love What happened then?
You're in love For you took the world... We have so much to discuss, madame.
Shall we retire until this silly entertainment's over?
A splendid idea.
And life was never like this before Good evening, monsieur.
And how is Madame Latour?
Very well, thank you.
Come, my dear.
And remind me to tell you of the time Marshal La Fouche came to dinner.
He arrived even later than usual, full of excuses.
Dreams come true Will those two ladies please get out of here and stop disturbing my song?
Can that creature be shouting at us?
I can, and I am!
Come.
Since no one is interested in my song, I'm sure you'll excuse me.
Never in all my experience have I seen anything like this.
Well, what can you expect?
She's from Madame Brizar's.
But surely, she didn't expect us to listen to her.
Why did you ruin my song?
Your manners, my girl, need correction.
Manners?
Is it manners to talk while you're being entertained and to walk out in the middle of a song?
I am not accustomed to such impudence.
Kindly leave the room.
And I'm not accustomed to the rude behavior of an ill-mannered snob.
Get out of here, you dressed-up scullery maid.
Oh!
So we're going to talk about clothes, are we?
Then let's start with that dress.
How dare you?
Why not?
I wore it before you did.
This dress came from Paris.
So Captain Kingston told me.
But I didn't like it.
Much too gauche.
Liar!
I seem to remember having put my foot through the inner hem.
But you'll find it quite neatly mended.
Guttersnipe!
Cow!
Oh!
Please stop.
No.
This is terrible!
You must stop it!
Please!
Good evening, Monsieur Narbonne.
It's been such a pleasant party.
Debbie...
Excuse me!
Arlene...
Excuse me!
Captain Duval?
Mademoiselle?
There is something I want you to do for me, Captain, in your official capacity as Chief of Police.
Mademoiselle has but to command.
Permit me to offer you my apologies, mademoiselle.
The apology, monsieur, is owed to me by someone else.
But first, Robert, you and I are going to discuss gowns, specifically this gown.
I assure you, it was all perfectly innocent.
I can't believe that anything associated with that creature was innocent.
And now, Captain Duval, I would like to resume our conversation without interruptions.
My sympathies, Captain.
I'm afraid it has been an unfortunate evening for you.
So that's what happened.
I disgraced you thoroughly.
Mmm-hmm.
Well, go on, say it.
The best client you ever had, and I... Did just what I always wanted to do.
Why, madame.
How often, when I was a young singer, did I feel just the same way?
But slapping the face of the Governor's niece... Oh, no.
Oh, yes.
Well, I don't care if she's his mother, she deserved it.
Of course, her being engaged to Captain Kingston had nothing to do with it?
That woman, engaged to...
I don't believe it.
Well, for two years, everybody else has believed it.
Two years?
Well, he can't love her very much.
Debbie.
For all our sakes, forget about Captain Kingston.
And leave him at the mercy of that ill-tempered witch?
I couldn't.
He doesn't know what he's getting himself into.
Doesn't that apply to most husbands?
Who can that be at this hour?
Open, in the name of the law!
I'll take care of it, Toussaint.
Open!
Open, I say!
Have pity on my door.
What do you want?
We have a warrant for the arrest of Deborah McCoy.
Mercy.
What has she done?
She is charged with assault on the person of Mademoiselle Arlene Villon.
Well, she's not here.
Keep them out as long as you can, Toussaint.
Run, get out of here.
Where will I go?
What's the difference?
Just make sure that they don't find you.
Hurry, hurry, hurry!
Open!
Open, I say.
Here, you've no time to get dressed.
Wait.
Here, put this on, and out of the window.
Upstairs.
Halt!
Come back here.
Sorry, I have a previous engagement.
Ahoy, there!
Ahoy!
Who be you, and what do you want?
Good evening, Jared.
Oh, no.
Not you again.
I knew you'd be glad to see me.
You can't come aboard in that fashion.
Do you want to start a riot?
I just did.
Is the Captain aboard?
No, and if he was, he'd probably toss you back into the sea.
I doubt it.
You see, Captain Kingston and I know too much about each other.
When he comes aboard, tell him I'll be waiting in his cabin.
I warn you, the master won't like it.
He'll like it.
I wasn't expecting you before daylight, sir.
What do you think it is now?
Daylight.
Make ready to sail!
A Narbonne ship is due!
Aye, sir.
Only there is a lady...
If you're interested in a lady, you can see her when we return.
It isn't me, sir.
It's the lady... Stop chattering about ladies.
I've had enough of them tonight to last me a lifetime.
Weigh anchor before we miss the tide.
Aye, sir.
Hands, raise up the sails!
Away, you lubbers!
Aye, sir.
Take the helm.
Forward, main braces!
Away, you lubbers!
Good morning.
Oh, no.
I hope you enjoyed yourself at Monsieur Narbonne's.
For hours I've wanted to get my hands on you.
Why, Frederic!
To choke you.
Why, I've never known you to be so violent.
Why in the name of seven red devils did you have to mention that dress?
I'll answer that when you tell me why your charming fiance broke up my song.
We are not talking about her.
I am.
And in the days to come, I'll tell you many things of her, each one worse than the last.
And what makes you think I'm going to let you stay here?
I'm afraid you're going to have to, Frederic.
You see, the police are after me.
And you, of all people, wouldn't want me in the hands of the police.
So now it's blackmail?
Oh, no, Frederic.
Devotion.
I'll have a cabin prepared for you.
My usual one, if you don't mind.
Quartermaster, watch your helm.
Aye, aye, sir.
Bring her to until she's trim.
Luff a quarter point.
Luff a quarter point.
When you raid the ship, Jared, don't forget to select a dress for me.
Maybe you'd like to board her with us for a fitting?
If this wind holds, we'll be off the Floridas in the morning.
We'll lay to and wait.
Are you planning to vote the Governor a share of the haul, Captain, for giving you the information?
What information?
That's none of your affair.
When we sight the ship, you'll go to your cabin and stay there.
All right, you don't have to tell me.
I know all about it.
With my very own ears I heard Monsieur Narbonne tell Patout that he was expecting three ships from Paris.
You heard him say what?
That he was expecting three ships from Paris.
What a fool I've been, Jared!
What a fool!
They set a trap for me and used the Governor to spring it.
Then there's no ship from Spain?
Of course there's a ship from Spain.
Probably a converted man-of-war, armed to the gallows and ready to blast us to the bottom of the sea.
Alter course, Jared.
Narbonne can have his ship from Spain.
And we'll have his ships from Paris and hoist him by his own petard!
Helm, hard a-larboard!
Hard a-larboard, sir!
Away there!
Braces, topsails and courses!
Watch your wind!
Debbie, remind me to buy you some earrings for those sharp little ears of yours.
I will.
Sail ho!
Where away?
Two points off the larboard bow, sir!
Make it so.
Prepare for action, Jared.
She's flying the Narbonne flag.
Aye, sir.
Fore and main braces, slack all!
Fore and main braces, slack all!
Helm a-lee!
Bring her to.
Main braces, let go all.
Show them who we are, Jared.
I'm going below.
Debbie, go to your cabin.
And miss all the excitement?
Not me.
You heard the captain's orders.
So did you.
Show them who we are.
Hoist the Roger!
Pirates!
Man the guns, and prepare to repel boarders.
Man the guns!
Prepare to repel boarders!
Gun tackles away!
Clear your vents!
Load!
Set and ready, sir.
Prime guns.
Prime guns!
I thought I told you to go to your cabin.
Who are you supposed to be?
Baptiste, the cutthroat.
We disguise the ship when we leave New Orleans.
I don't want to be recognized either.
Then why don't you stay in your cabin?
Because I belong up here, but you don't.
Take her as she comes!
Rake her!
Fire!
Fire!
Look out!
Boarders, stand by!
Make fast those grapnels!
Prepare to board, lads!
Clear the main decks!
Drive them aft!
Boarders away!
Not bad, Captain.
Daring, but late.
And now, Captain, we can discuss things calmly.
How long before they make land?
A few days, but they're well provisioned.
That's another secret you've got to keep, Debbie.
I'd lose my standing as a pirate if word got around I spared my victims' lives.
There she be.
That's one for Davy Jones and two more a-coming.
And this makes two.
And still another to come.
There she be!
Jared, an extra ration of grog for the men.
Make it three extra rations.
One for each ship.
Oh, I could use a bit of grog myself.
I guess I'm not cut out for this occupation of pirating.
That part of it's all over.
We sail for Martinique to sell the cargo, and then, Debbie, we go home to New Orleans.
Long life to ye both!
No sleep tonight, Debbie?
No.
If you're worrying about the police, don't.
I can take care of that ridiculous charge the moment we land.
What can you do about this being our last night out?
All voyages must end sometime.
Why?
You could just turn this ship around and keep on sailing.
You forget my friends at the Seamen's Fund and my business with them.
To say nothing of Mademoiselle Villon, and your business with her.
That, too, Debbie.
I'd hoped you'd understand.
I don't at all, but I know what you're going to say.
What you've been leading up to for the past three days.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't it go something like this?
"Debbie, "this is a difficult moment for both of us, but one we have to face.
"Now, being together these past few months "has made us forget everyone but ourselves, "and led us to believe that everything has changed.
"But tomorrow we land in New Orleans, we meet our old friends, "and discover that nothing has changed, "least of all my feeling toward Mademoiselle Villon."
That doesn't sound very pretty.
Perhaps you could make it sound more attractive.
No.
No matter what words I use, the meaning would be the same.
I'm sorry, Debbie.
I hope you'll forgive me.
And I hope that you... That you'll be very happy.
Four bells and all's well!
That's what you think.
Captain Duval, there's a Captain Kingston to see you.
Show him right in.
Welcome home, Kingston.
I hadn't heard you were back.
We dropped anchor this morning.
Any sign of Baptiste?
None.
Monsieur Narbonne was not so fortunate.
He lost three more ships.
Bad business.
Tsk, tsk, tsk.
Well, what brings you here?
I have a small favor to ask.
It concerns a girl.
But you only anchored this morning.
This occurred before I sailed.
Some trifling charge.
Assault, I believe.
But I feel a certain responsibility in the matter and promised to help her.
And her name?
Deborah McCoy.
Oh, that one.
Now I understand.
Understand what?
Why the charges were made, and why they were dropped.
Consider the matter closed, Captain.
The complainant requested the same favor.
She did?
Of course, right after her marriage.
As Madame Narbonne, she recognized it would be most unseemly for her to be jealous of anyone but Monsieur Narbonne.
You are speaking of Mademoiselle Villon?
Of course.
Forgive me, Captain, I assumed you would've been the first to have heard.
It appears I've made a dreadful mistake.
Apparently, I have been saved from making a greater one.
Robert.
This is a surprise.
It is a day of surprises, madame.
My belated best wishes to you, and my congratulations to Monsieur Narbonne.
No anger, Robert?
That's not very flattering.
At the risk of upsetting you, madame, I find myself less angry than perplexed.
How well you control your emotions, Robert.
But you did come to see me.
And I must confess I'm pleased.
A minor confession, madame.
No other is important.
There was always one fault with being in love with you.
You could do so well without me.
With Alexander, it's different.
He needs me.
I have the position to go with his wealth.
It's a convenient arrangement for both of us.
And, Robert, it's an arrangement that needn't too much affect you and me.
When last we met, you were quite violent about a young lady.
I was just thinking of the names you called her.
Are you comparing me to that guttersnipe?
No longer, madame, the comparison is too unfair to her.
Then I suggest you leave here and return to her.
No suggestion was ever more welcome, madame.
I called to offer you my congratulations.
I now extend my sympathy.
Get out.
Your husband will soon discover you are without honor.
You will soon discover he is without wealth.
This should be a happy arrangement for both of you.
You see, it has been a day of surprises, madame.
Patout, is it true that Alexander is in financial difficulties?
Captain Kingston tell you this?
Does it make any difference who told me?
A great deal, madame, since it is my belief he is responsible for those difficulties.
Kingston?
Or should I say, Baptiste, since they are one and the same?
You're out of your mind.
Both your husband and I have every reason to believe this.
Then why haven't you gone to the police?
For one reason, madame.
Because you and your uncle have always been his protector.
I would like nothing better than to see him hang.
If madame truly feels that way, perhaps we can arrange that event.
We have manifests of all the cargos lost when Baptiste looted our ships.
If any of these cargos are found aboard Kingston's ship, we have the proof we need.
I see.
Send Alexander to me as soon as he returns.
Madame, should the charges be proffered by the Governor's niece, Captain Duval would act even more quickly.
Of course, and Captain Kingston would be even more unhappy.
We've had an anxious day, Captain, wondering if it would be you or the police who would call on us.
I haven't even let Debbie unpack.
It is safe for her to do so, but I'm here to ask her not to.
Why not?
Does my presence in New Orleans embarrass you?
On the contrary, New Orleans itself embarrasses me.
Therefore I'm sailing immediately and want you to go with me.
Won't that be a little awkward?
You and I and Madame Narbonne?
Then you know?
Yes.
Madame Brizar was kind enough to tell me.
At which point I discovered that even a woman doesn't understand women.
They're very unpredictable creatures, as you're about to find out.
Debbie, I don't think you understand.
There's nothing to stop us now.
I'm ready to turn the ship around and keep on sailing.
So now you're ready?
Well, I'm not.
When you thought you could have Mademoiselle Villon, you didn't want me.
Well, now that you can't have her, I don't want you.
I came here, Debbie, because I discovered that it wasn't Mademoiselle Villon that I loved, it was you.
And I've discovered that I want no part of you.
I wasn't good enough for you and your friends last night.
Well, they're not good enough for me today.
Debbie, stop acting like a fool.
I wonder what your high and mighty friends would say if they knew that the gallant Captain Kingston was really Frederic Baptiste, a pirate.
Why don't you tell them?
Ahoy, Jared!
Answer him.
Ahoy, Captain!
How fitting that Captain Kingston should be the first to know we have captured Baptiste.
She wasted no time in coming to you, did she?
Did you expect her to?
Secure them below.
A sailor sails the seven seas And maybe seven more But when he's got his money saved He's better off ashore Oh!
A sailor sails the seven seas And maybe seven more But keep your women locked away The day he comes ashore I met a man from New Orleans one bright and sunny day He said he'd never leave me Then he up and sailed away He was gone for 15 years I thought that he was dead But he came back with bags of gold And here is what he said Oh!
A sailor sails the seven seas And maybe seven more Looks like we're wasting our time.
There isn't going to be any trouble here.
It's as peaceful as a clambake.
The Captain pays too much attention to informers.
My sister married Captain John A handsome sailor boy They had a happy family Till he heard a "ship ahoy" And then he got the urge to sail And so he left them all Now every time you pass her house You'll hear my sister call Oh!
A sailor sails the seven seas And maybe seven more But when he's got a wife and child He'll never come ashore I've known a lot of sailor boys The Captain and the crew I'll eat with them and drink with them And flirt with one or two But never will I marry one And here's the reason why The very day I marry one He'll up and say goodbye Oh!
A sailor sails the seven seas And maybe seven more And I'll be true to any man As long as he's ashore The town is quiet as can be But not for very long The moment that the ships come in You'll hear a sailor's song He's ready for a frolic So it's up to you and me To make each sailor wish that he had never seen the sea Oh!
A sailor sails the seven seas And maybe seven more And now I go to meet my love His ship has come ashore Now.
I do not condemn your motive, my son, only your method.
No other method would've been as effective.
To live by the sword is to perish by the sword.
You see where it has brought you?
If you'll permit me, Father, I see more clearly where a woman has brought me.
I have been to see this Mademoiselle McCoy.
She denies having betrayed you.
And I believe her.
Father, in your calling, you're supposed to believe.
Gentlemen, I'm overwhelmed by this honor.
And well you should be, pirate, for Monsieur Narbonne has come to offer you mercy.
Monsieur Narbonne's mercy can be more dangerous than his threats.
I pray you will be generous, sir.
Monsieur Narbonne has come as a friend.
And you're badly in need of friends, Baptiste.
The Governor has refused to see you.
Your execution is scheduled for dawn.
It appears that all is fair in love and war, and I have lost at both.
Perhaps not.
I have come to make you an offer.
Which you are in no position to refuse.
I am all ears, gentlemen.
In exchange for a simple statement from you, I'm convinced I can persuade the Governor to offer you a pardon, on the condition that you leave New Orleans forever.
And what is to be the nature of this statement?
A simple confession that the money you turned over to the Seamen's Fund for the purchase of new ships was really mine, procured by selling my cargo.
The court will then rule those transactions illegal.
And compel the owners of these ships to sign them over to you.
Precisely.
I would like nothing better than to sign such a statement, but I'm afraid I can't.
Why not?
You can't deny that you raided my ships.
I can deny it.
In fact, I will deny it.
Then you'll hang.
Too bad.
It seems such a ridiculous way to die.
Come, Patout, we're just wasting our time.
Open.
Monsieur, my compliments to your wife.
And my apologies for finding it impossible to replenish the Narbonne fortune.
She will at least have the satisfaction of seeing you hang.
As well as the reward for having exposed you.
Monsieur Patout!
You will never know how happy you've made me.
Line up, all of you.
Line up.
What is all this, Sergeant?
The fight at the Catfish, Captain.
The information you had was correct.
Lock them up.
Merely a routine brawl.
Bring them along.
Open up.
Come along.
Hurry up.
Move along.
Go on, get in there!
Now!
Mademoiselle, the keys.
Come on.
Debbie!
Jared!
Quick, where is he?
In the next cell.
Give me the keys.
Debbie, is it any wonder I love you?
Hurry, they'll have reinforcements here any moment.
If I hang for it, I'll have a kiss.
There'll be time for that later.
Come on.
Eight bells and all's well.
How right he is.
1 Rendezvous ship Essex sighted.
She flies the Navy pennant.
Sound the three-gun recognition salute.
Aye, aye, sir.
Mr. Farragut.
Yes, sir.
This is your end of the line.
l don't know what the Navy wants you to do, but good luck in your missin.
We'll do the best we can, sir.
The cargo trunks will go with you.
Surplus rations to follow.
Whatever's in store for them, they'll need a little comfort, poor devils.
Like music to me ears, Captain, singing a little song.
''Link, you're going home.'
' Three times l heard the tune now.
''Link, you're going home.'
' They finally sent relief.
l thought they'd forgotten us.
Not the Navy, sir.
They might misplace a ship now and then, but they never lose one permanent-like.
Have all hands report to service quarters.
They'll be boarding us soon.
Aye, aye, sir.
Can l start the scuttlebutt, sir, about going home?
Yes, Mr. Link, start the scuttlebutt.
NARRATOR/ Latitude 14 degrees north, 74 degrees west.
The middIe of the Caribbean Sea, and a young navaI officer named David Farragut who is destined to pIay an important part in one of the strangest stories ever toId about the United States Navy.
OFFlCER: Starboard watch, inward turn!
Why, it's Midshipman Farragut.
Lieutenant David Farragut reporting, sir, with new orders for the captain of the Essex.
Carry on with your orders, Mr. Farragut.
The Essex is to embark upon a secret missin so hazardous that the Navy Department gives the ship's complement the choice of staying aboard or transferring to the Lexington.
We've been in these waters a year now.
l was under the impressin we were setting sail for home.
lf such members of the complement are transferred, it's to be within the next hour.
May l ask what this missin calls for?
Here, sir.
To be opened eight hours after sail has been set from the rendezvous.
The necessary cargoes are alongside in the boats.
That's all they said?
Nothing about rotating the ship and sending it back?
These men need a rest.
As an officer, l just carry out my orders, sir.
l learned that as a midshipman.
You had a lot to learn as a midshipman, Mr. Farragut.
You've more to learn now that you've been commissioned.
Pity l can't continue teaching you.
Men, the news l bring you now will not sit lightly.
The Essex is not going home.
lnstead, we've been ordered on a secret missin by the Navy, a missin so filled with risk that future service aboard this ship is voluntary.
All men wishing to transfer to the Lexington, step forward one pace.
You seem to have lost your command, sir.
lt's only fair to tell you, men, rumor has it that the Lexington is not returning to the States but continuing to Africa for extended service against the slave traders.
But, Captain... Something you didn't learn as a midshipman, Mr. Farragut, a ship can't sail without a crew.
Now go back and tell your captain we're pulling under way.
l'm to remain aboard the Essex as your executive officer, sir.
A ship this size doesn't need any added commissioned personnel.
Orders from the Navy Department because of the nature of the missin.
l trust you will find time to continue your teaching, sir.
Secret missin to who knows where, a homesick crew with a year's service, and a new square-pants executive officer from Washington.
Very well.
Stand by to make sail.
Good evening, Mr. Link.
Keep steady your course.
l'll be back shortly.
What course?
With them new provisions aboard, we can sail on for a year from anywhere to nowhere and back again.
Just keep your course, mate.
As long as your keel ain't run aground, you ain't got no cause for complaint.
Well, Davey, me lad, you sure have grown.
Lieutenant Farragut, Mr. Link.
Can't you recognize an officer?
Brass buttons and all.
Seems like only yesterday you was a squirt of a midshipman l was fetching out of the drink.
For which l'll always be grateful.
Well, petty officers must be getting scarce.
l see they've made you a chief.
About the time the Captain got command of this ship.
We're all up in the service these days, Davey-lad.
l expected him to be an admiral by now.
He's got what it takes, all right.
All guts and no heart.
Ain't no sense in keeping that grudge forever.
As an instructor, it was his job to chew midshipmen off, and just between us two, you gave him plenty of cause.
When a man's religion is the book of naval regulations, he's gotta be sour inside, and our captain's a very sour man, Mr. Link.
You're wrong, Davey.
He lives by the book, sure, but he's never stepped out of line with the men yet.
You know what, Link?
l'm just waiting for the day.
What day?
When he takes that one big step, when he makes one move from here.
l'll bet a year's pay that day never comes.
Well, now, then maybe l could offer a suggestion or two, for better officer relations, mind you.
What l mean is, if l knew what we was up to on this cruise...
The orders are sealed.
You and the men will know when we do.
Mr. Farragut, l'd like to see you below, sir.
Aye, aye, sir.
One more thing, Davey-lad.
The Lexington, she really wasn't going to service in Africa?
lt's like the Captain said, Mr. Link.
He's commissioned, all right.
He's even lying like an officer.
Come in, Mr. Farragut.
Sit down, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Mr. Farragut, you served under me as a midshipman, and as student and instructor, our relations were, shall we say, somewhat strained.
However, since you've been designated my executive, through no choice of ours, we serve together again.
Yes, sir.
l would like, then, to have the following understood.
l'll expect nothing more or less of you than of any other officer in my command.
You'll be judged solely by your actions on this ship.
lt's a new book, Mr. Farragut.
What goes on the pages is up to you.
Do we understand each other?
We do, sir.
We're eight hours out from rendezvous.
Time to open this box.
Aye, aye, sir.
Jolly Roger?
What the devil, l...
This is incredible.
To use a ship of the line for this... We're to lose our identity, Mr. Farragut.
''Orders are to remove all visible naval identification, ''both in armament and dress, ''to act independently of government restrictions ''in seeking out the pirate fleet operating in these waters ''and report such findings to the United States naval base ''at Charleston for flotilla action.'
' Do you mean they want us to act as pirates, sir?
Throw away all the discipline and order l've worked these past years to maintain, take a crew that's overdue for leave and ask them to volunteer for this kind of duty, and l'm the one who has to go up there and tell them.
Yes, Mr. Link?
Good evening, sir.
l was just wondering if there was anything you might be wanting before l retire to my humble quarters.
l suppose you heard every word.
Every word, sir.
And how do you think the men will take it?
l just figured out a few things that might ease the pain, so to speak.
lt's always darkest before the dawn, they say, Captain.
Then roust them out at dawn, Mr. Link.
Aye, aye, sir.
That'll be all, Mr. Farragut.
See you at formation.
Yes, sir.
Yo, ho, ho, and a bottle of rum.
All gear will be weighed down and cast over the side.
You'll find suitable clothing in these cargo cases.
Officers will go through their belongings and destroy any papers bearing identification.
We're not to put ashore at any time, and should we be forced into action, remember we are privateers.
We can expect no aid or recognition from our government.
Now, since we are all volunteers, we realize the importance of our missin.
The pirates in these waters are raiding our merchant ships.
The bureau in Washington can't spare half the Atlantic fleet to track them down.
We will find them and let the Navy do the rest.
This is our job.
Gentlemen, we are now a ship without a country.
Mr. Farragut, prepare ship for missin.
Aye, aye, sir.
Square away on deck, men.
What's the course?
West by... Well, what are you smiling at?
Nothing.
Nothing at all, sir.
She's still dipping, sir.
l'm afraid we're in for a rough one.
l'll go forward and take a fix.
Who stands the late watch?
Mr. Farragut, sir.
Have the mate send Mr. Farragut my compliments.
l want to see him on deck.
Aye, aye, sir.
Give us a hand, mate.
Captain.
l didn't know... l mean, that it was you, sir.
The phrase ''comrade in arms'' does not mean slapping the Captain overboard, Mr. Link.
What's that rum casket doing on deck?
Well, l was figuring, this being a pirate ship, we should have the rum casket where all can see it, sir.
l'm not aware l made you officer in charge of ship alterations.
Now, get rid of it, and report back to me.
Yes, sir.
Right away, sir.
l suppose next they'll want me to do a hornpipe from the rigging.
Lieutenant Farragut reporting as ordered, sir.
l'm sorry, sir, but that getup... l'm glad my appearance delights you.
May l say you look more in character out of uniform?
And what's that medallion around your neck?
Does it bear any personal identification?
No, sir.
lt just says Guierre, the name of the new training ship from which l was commissioned.
Get rid of it.
But, sir, it's my good-luck piece.
l'm sure it couldn't be identified.
l said get rid of it, Mr. Farragut.
What goes for one goes for all.
l took a fix.
The winds are rising with every indication we're in for a big blow.
You ever handled a ship during a storm?
No, sir.
This is your chance.
Storm should hit its peak during your watch.
Keep the lifeline secure, and report any structure damage.
Come with me.
Yes, Chief Petty Officer Link?
Reporting as ordered, sir.
Continue your account of the rum casket.
Well, like l was saying, a privateer needs a rum casket on deck, like in those stories and songs, so l borrowed the rum from sickbay.
But this is not a privateer.
lt's a United States man-of-war.
Rum rations are for the sick.
You know the law of the sea.
lt's confusing, sir.
First, we're pirates.
Then we're Navy.
lt gets a fellow all muddled up in his thinking.
lf l may say so, sir, l think Mr. Link has a point.
The rum should be left on deck.
A very good suggestion, Lieutenant.
And Mr. Link should be responsible for it at all times, sir.
l'll guard it with my life, so help me.
Do that, Mr. Link.
Guard it 24 hours a day, and when this tour of duty is finished, l'm going to break it open, and if there's as much as one mouthful missing from the present count, you'll lose your rank and your pensin.
But, Captain...
Carry on.
Yes, sir.
Stand your watch, Mr. Farragut.
You want me, l'll be below.
Yes, sir.
l mean what l say, Lieutenant.
l don't want to see that medallion again.
You ever see a big blow, Mr. Link?
Of course, Davey-lad.
Well, they're commanding ships nowadays.
Just thought you'd like to know.
Lifelines secured, sir.
Order the watch below.
Keep the deck clear of crew.
Aye, aye, sir.
Keep her steady into the storm.
Get below!
Let's clear the planks.
Step with it, mates!
Help!
Help!
Did you hear that, sir?
LlNK: Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Cargo's free on the foredeck.
Count to 35, mister, then throw her hard to starboard.
lf she hits some waves broadside, she'll crack in two.
lt's hard to starboard on the count of 35.
Now start to count.
Aye, aye, sir.
One.
Two.
Two.
Three.
Four.
Six.
Seven.
Eight.
Nine.
Ten.
Eleven.
Twelve.
Thirteen.
Fourteen.
Fifteen.
Sixteen.
Seventeen.
Eighteen.
Nineteen.
Davey-lad, l... Count!
Twenty.
Twenty-one.
Twenty-two.
Twenty-three.
Twenty-three.
Twenty-four.
Twenty-four.
Twenty-five.
l can't call the deck watch... Twenty-six.
...or they'll all find out about your blasted thirst!
Twenty-seven.
Now, grab my arm on the count of 33.
Twenty-eight.
And lurch out at 35.
You got that?
Twenty-nine.
Thirty.
Thirty-one.
Thirty-one.
Thirty-two.
Thirty-two.
Thirty-three.
Thirty-three.
Thirty-four.
Thirty-five.
Thirty-five.
Rudder smashed!
Rudder smashed!
Get below without a word.
But, Davey... Not a word to anyone, you understand?
You weren't on deck.
This evens us up, Mr. Link.
Now move on.
Aye, aye, sir.
Where away, mister?
Full starboard command from Mr. Farragut, sir.
The rudder's been busted.
Stand general quarters.
Stand to general quarters!
Full starboard.
Was that your command, Mr. Farragut?
Aye, sir.
Full starboard into a storm?
The deck cargoes broke loose, sir.
You've got a crew.
Why didn't you use them?
l was afraid the men would be chopped down by the loose end.
They're sailors.
A common seaman wouldn't yield to starboard in a storm.
Can't get through without a rudder.
We'll have to lighten our load and try to roll over it.
Jettison all bulk cargo and supplies.
We won't hold out a week like that, sir.
l don't envy you, Mr. Farragut.
You won't be the most popular man aboard after we ride out this storm.
lf we ride it out.
What's the damage, Mr. Considine?
Well, the check chains on the rudder have been carried away, sir.
They could be reset to last until we head to port.
How long will it take?
Two, maybe three hours.
The Caribbean is shark water.
l won't risk men down there that long.
Thank you, Mr. Considine.
Aye, aye, sir.
Still west by northwest, Mr. Farragut?
West by northwest, sir.
We're drifting into the Gulf Stream current.
With luck and some wind for our sails, it will carry us to the West lndies.
There, we'll take on provisions and repair the damage.
That's if we don't run into the pirate fleet first.
Without a rudder, we'd be a sitting target.
Carry on, Lieutenant, and pray for clear sailing.
Oh, Captain?
Yes?
l'd like to volunteer for salvage-diving duty, sir.
l'm aware of the many things on your conscience, sir, and also that a rudderless ship of short rations takes longer to reach its destination, but l won't let the sharks get any part of you.
l want my executive officer to stand court-martialed on both feet.
Word from sickbay, sir.
Doctor confirms report.
lt's scurvy that Harrison's down with.
Any fresh food or potatoes left aboard?
No, sir.
Mr. Farragut?
Yes, sir?
The men need a tonic.
Break out a rum ration for ship's complement.
Mr. Link will supervise.
Carry on.
Aye, aye, sir.
l'm sorry for showing me thirst, Davey-lad, and causing you all this hurt.
Let me tell the Captain...
Secure all hands for rum ration, Mr. Link.
Then we'll have our say.
Aye, aye, sir.
Forsythe.
Forsythe, draw ration for one.
Christie.
Christie, draw ration for one.
Rum issue completed, sir.
Thank you, Mr. Redell.
Well, that does it, Davey-lad.
Now for old Link's ration.
l suggest you save some of that until after we fix the rudder, Mr. Link.
The rudder?
l ain't fixing no rudder.
You heard the Captain say those fish bite hard.
Topside at eight bells.
We're responsible for this mess, and l couldn't be in much more trouble.
Bring a lubber hose from the forecastle, and not a word to anyone.
But you're not listening, Davey.
Eight bells, Chief.
The blooming gold braid knew how hard l worked for this drink, they'd make me an admiral for my drive and spirit.
All clear, Davey-lad.
Good.
Now, my idea is to replace the shackle on the stay chains.
But it ain't enough.
She'll break away again.
lt's worth a last chance to try to sail her in.
There's no guarantee we'll drift to port before the food runs out and the scurvy gets worse.
Hand me that lubber hose.
Now, two pulls on this rope brings me up.
Lower away.
Stand-by watch!
On the double!
Get below.
l'll take care of him.
You all right, Davey-boy?
The shark almost got me.
No chance to fix those stay chains.
But you were told not to try to fix the stay chains, Mr. Farragut.
You will remain to quarters until further orders.
Aye, aye, sir.
Better fetch the doctor.
That won't be necessary, sir.
l'm quite all right.
Captain Porter, sir.
Look.
LlNK: lt's the wind, sir.
lt's come.
We'll be blown into the currents.
Well... lt appears, Mr. Farragut, in spite of you, we may reach land.
Bosun, all hands.
Loosen all canvas.
Square away and stand by.
All hands!
Six days of this drifting.
Those topsiders don't know where we're headed.
Farragut's the one.
What with his navigation, we'll never see home again.
Mr. Redell.
Yes, sir.
You're sure these figures are accurate?
They've been double-checked, sir.
Even at half rations, there's barely enough supplies for three days more.
ln that case, we'll cut to quarter rations.
lnform the crew and officers.
Aye, aye, sir.
SAlLOR: Hungry, you say?
Now, how can that be?
You ate yesterday, didn't you?
Sure.
Why, look at him.
He's fat as a pig.
Why, l'll bet if you was to put a nice juicy leg of lamb in front of him right this moment... What's all the fussing, lads?
We was figuring what we was gonna eat next, the mainsail or our shoes.
That's enough from you.
Mend your nets and be quiet about it.
SAlLOR 2: Land ho!
Where away?
Dead ahead.
Land, sir.
Where away?
Dead ahead, sir.
Take soundings for it.
Anchor at six fathoms.
Prepare landing parties.
Aye, aye, sir.
Now, Mr. Farragut, if you'll join me in my cabin?
Yes, sir.
By my calculations, we're somewhere along the Mosquito Coast, in here.
We've reached a natural harbor, so we'll have a chance to fix the rudder.
You'll take a party ashore and provisin up.
Now, this is Spanish territory, and, as pirates, we have no landing rights.
My orders are to create no incident.
Do l make myself clear?
Very clear, sir.
Move ashore and get the provisions.
Aye, aye, sir.
Mr. Farragut.
l'm putting you in charge of this expedition because l need my gunnery and salvage officers aboard.
You'll please me no end by accomplishing one missin without breaking any naval regulations.
And if we run into trouble, sir?
You know the answer.
To save the ship and the nature of the missin, l'd be forced to abandon you and sail away.
Has the Captain any instructions in the case of that emergency?
The men will have to fend for themselves.
lt shouldn't be too difficult for you, Mr. Farragut.
You've worked alone during most of your naval career.
Come in.
That'll be all, Mr. Farragut.
Yes, Mr. Redell?
Good news, Captain.
The doctor reports our single case of scurvy's in check, and with fresh supplies coming aboard, there's little chance of another outbreak.
Yes, sir, l'd say we have nothing more to fear.
Mr. Redell, with Mr. Farragut loose ashore, there's always something to fear.
Secure craft.
Mr. Link, forward.
Separate the men into small groups.
Pick anything from the trees and land that's edible.
Aye, aye, sir.
On the double, Link.
This is strange country.
Oh, relax, Davey-lad.
Ain't a thing gonna bother you.
Water beakers are filled, sir.
Good.
Well, that's about the last of it.
Fire the completion signal, and we'll move out.
Very good, sir.
Redell.
Yes, sir?
You seen Link?
Not since he and Beckett went off scrounging, sir.
lt's past time they were back.
l'm going to check.
Here.
Take two boats back to the ship.
Leave a crew for me.
We'll return presently.
Aye, aye, sir.
Crew on boats one and two.
Stand by to return.
I mash 'em I muck 'em I grow 'em I truck 'em Yo, ho, ho, it's the Iife for me I mash 'em I muck 'em Mr. Link, what in blazes are you doing?
A method of mine, sir, for refilling the keg, crushed wine with me own feet.
Add a little alcohol from sickbay, and we've a drink onboard for emergencies.
Beckett, are you in on this?
Well, l was...
He's with me, sir, by my instructions.
l told you once before our accounts are squared.
Now, l've seen none of this, Mr. Link.
lt's all your problem to explain away.
l'm heading back for the boat.
We shove off in short order with or without you.
As the saying goes, Beckett-lad, looks like l put both feet in it this time.
Report, Mr. Considine.
Rudder's been fixed, sir.
She's ready to go.
Good.
Mr. Redell.
Shore party all onboard?
Well, not exactly, sir.
Mr. Farragut and Mr. Link aren't back yet.
What happened to them?
They'll be along, sir.
Along?
What do you mean, along?
Well, that's all Mr. Farragut said, Captain, when he ordered me back.
Farragut again.
Probably dreams of capturing the island single-handedly and raising the American flag.
Well!
Well!
ls that all you have to say?
lt will cover my sentiments for now.
Then l will speak.
You are the Captain of the ship in the harbor?
No, lovely lady, l am not.
But you're an officer of that ship.
Well, for the present, yes.
l wish to buy passage.
Passage?
Well, isn't it customary to ask where a ship is bound for first?
lt does not matter, and l pay gold.
A beautiful woman from nowhere ready to pay gold for passage to anywhere?
lt doesn't make sense.
Do l or do l not get passage?
No, you don't.
My ship is a privateer.
We can't... l was afraid such an emergency might arise.
Shall we go?
l have little choice, but as for my captain, that pistol will do no good.
His stomach is made of steel.
How long we gonna wait, Mr. Link?
We've waited long enough.
l got that feeling.
l'm going after him.
lf we ain't back by dusk, you go back to the ship.
But, Mr. Link... Do as l say.
lt's Mr. Farragut.
Yeah.
But what with?
Davey-lad, we were just going after you.
Who are all these characters?
These characters carry the wardrobe of our passenger.
Passenger?
You know we can't take a passenger.
And just in case you're not convinced...
Yes, l guess we can take a passenger.
Beckett, have those lndians stow the gear, and we'll move out.
This way.
Davey-lad, what's the skipper gonna say about her?
l shudder to think, Mr. Link.
l shudder to think.
Captain Porter, sir?
Yes?
Long boat approaching.
All hands onboard?
Hard to tell, sir.
Mr. Redell?
Yes, Captain?
ls that a woman?
ls who a woman, sir?
The woman in the boat with Mr. Farragut.
That ain't no woman, sir.
That's Mr. Link.
Since when does a chief wear skirts and blouses?
Give Mr. Farragut my compliments.
Ask him to join me with his companion.
Aye, aye, sir.
Compliments of the Captain, sir.
He requests that... l know, Mr. Redell.
lf you'll follow me, please.
Captain Porter, this is...
Yes, Mr. Farragut?
l am the Countess Margarita La Reguna, and l wish passage.
This ship carries no passengers.
That's what l told her, sir, but she can convince you.
lndeed.
How can she convince me?
With that pistol she carries in her traveling bag, sir.
l'll relieve you of your sidearms.
There's no pistol here.
But...
Believe me... Would you wait in my cabin, please?
Mr. Redell will show you the way.
This way, Miss.
Mr. Farragut, at what now seems an eternity, you brought orders for this command to seek out the pirate fleet.
Since then, you have smashed my ship in a storm, risked lives against my orders, and now, at the point of a gun which l cannot find, you've brought a female passenger onboard, but no pirates, Mr. Farragut.
We've been so busy covering your mistakes, there's been no time for pirates.
l doubt if Captain Kidd himself could have scuttled this missin more successfully than you have.
Now, what about this woman?
lt's as l said, sir.
She paid some lndians to bushwhack me, then forced me to bring her aboard.
What does she know about this ship?
Nothing, sir.
Very well.
Follow me.
We'll put her ashore.
Put her back in place, Beckett-lad.
And no officer's the wiser.
Yeah, but if the Captain...
The Captain's got his head full now.
A lovely lady is all the wine an officer needs.
Countess, there's no sense wasting time.
l've given orders to put you ashore.
But l will pay well.
l have gold.
The lndians didn't take it from you?
The lndians were my friends.
They protected me when l left Foxardo.
Foxardo?
We've drifted into the heart of the Spanish territory.
Suppose you tell me the truth.
There was no gun, was there?
No gun, sir.
l brought her aboard because she needed help.
You realize this is a further admissin of your guilt, Mr. Farragut.
Yes, sir.
All l want is the truth.
Now, Countess, what is the truth?
That l am Portuguese, but for many years, l've lived in Brazil, so now l feel that Rio is my home.
You're a long way from home.
Too long.
But when Napoleon overran Europe, the royal family and many of the nobility, my family among them, fled to Brazil, taking with them their priceless belongings.
Now, with all the danger passed, the King has returned to his throne in Portugal.
Well, isn't that where he belongs?
lf he so chooses, but many of us do not feel the same.
Like you Americans, we prefer the New Worid with its freedoms and its opportunities for all, and we'll fight for this independence of thought and action.
But l don't see quite how all this...
The King demands a return to Portugal, not only of ourselves but of all our woridly goods.
Which you refused?
lf a young country is to survive, it must have trade alliances.
All our gold and valued possessions are collected for that purpose.
Just where do you fit into all this political maneuvering?
My father and l were returning from England, where the trade alliances were made.
ln payment, our ships sail from Rio in three months with all our fortunes on them, unless l stop them.
Why do that?
My father carried sailing instructions for our fleet.
ln Havana, we were attacked by Portuguese agents.
l managed to escape, but my father was killed, and his papers were stolen.
With these plans known, our ships are sure to be attacked, and they must be warned.
Suppose all this is true, you must realize that we are privateers.
We do not head toward Rio.
But at least you sail the seas, and there is chance of transfer to a vessel bound towards home, but on land, l have no chance at all.
Come in.
Excuse me, sir.
The lady's baggage.
Bring it aboard, and prepare to sail.
Aye, aye, sir.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
l must warn you, this is a privateer, and you must assume all risks.
You're aboard as a political refugee asking passage.
l take no sides.
l understand.
Very well, you may use this cabin.
l'll double up with Mr. Farragut.
lf you'll excuse me, l'll get underway.
What did you do with that pistol?
lt served its purpose.
l slipped it into the water.
Besides, it was bare of ammunition.
Very well done, Your Highness.
You lied for me.
lt was appreciated.
Lovely lady, please pray that l grow to be a very old man.
Why, l will, but why?
Because only a man past 90 will smell salt air again after the Captain finishes with me.
Set course a big circle, and close the gaps.
lf there are any pirate ships in these waters, we'll find them.
Aye, aye, sir.
When the spinner goes over the rail, the number of knots on the line to run out during a 28-second interval is equal to the speed of the ship through water.
After a few more lessons, Captain, l'll be ready for my master's paper.
When you sign on your crew, l hope you'll think of me as first mate, perhaps.
l think not.
Somehow l can't imagine you as anything but a captain.
l'm not sure that's a compliment.
Well, of course it is.
There's something most impressive about a man whose only thoughts are of his duties and responsibilities.
Perhaps before too long l'll be less bound by duty and responsibility.
Time for your afternoon stroll, Countess.
l hope l haven't kept you waiting.
Oh, no, l've been well occupied.
Would the Captain care to join us?
Why, yes.
Yes, of course.
Mr. Farragut, cargo secured?
Yes, sir.
Watches posted?
Yes, sir.
Sick report filed?
Yes, sir.
You're very efficient, Mr. Farragut.
Thank you, sir.
Countess?
SAlLOR: Sail ho!
Where away?
Bearing fine on larboard quarter.
Can't get her colors, but she flies the recognition pennant.
How is she heading?
Starboard tack, close-hauled, closing fast, sir.
Up helm.
Back your topsail!
Square away fore and main!
Belay!
Mr. Farragut?
Yes, sir?
ln view of our missin, l'd like to avoid a fight if possible.
However, if it comes to a showdown, pipe stand to quarters, Mr. Farragut, and clear for action.
Aye, aye, sir.
Stand to quarters!
Clear for action!
She's hoisted her colors, sir, but still wants recognition.
Can you make her out?
Not yet, sir.
She wants our colors, sir.
She'll have to wait.
Why doesn't the Captain show his flag?
Well, you see, ma'am, we're privateers-like.
We got no country.
Awkward, ain't it?
We better get something on that flag mast before they blow us to bits.
Quarters cleared for action, sir.
My glass, Mr. Link.
Aye, aye, sir.
Now, Countess, l suggest you go to your cabin.
l prefer to take my chances on deck.
ln that case, l must insist.
l can't assume responsibility for your safety here.
Mr. Redell.
Yes, Captain?
Take the Countess to her cabin.
Aye, aye, sir.
This way, Countess.
CAPTAlN: White field, green St. George's cross.
She's Portuguese, sir.
CAPTAlN: First-class ship of the line.
That means she carries twice the guns and crew that we have aboard.
Now we're really in for it.
l've tried to avoid hoisting our colors with a girl aboard, but the missin comes first.
Shall l break out the flag, sir?
Not yet.
Save it as a surprise.
lt should have some shock value.
Meantime, have the men draw sidearms, and prepare for heavy action.
lf we have to fight, Mr. Farragut, let's be sure to win.
Aye, aye, sir.
And still she flies no flag?
No, sir.
Fire another warning across her bow, close across her bow!
Stand by bow gun.
That didn't miss by much.
lt missed, didn't it?
Stand by and hold fast.
Mr. Farragut, secure the pennant from the flag box, and break it aloft at my command.
Aye, aye, sir.
Men!
That ship bearing down on us has twice our range and firepower.
We've got to get 'em in tight before we let go a broadside.
l want them in so close you can spit in their eyes after loading.
Light your ready matches, cast loose, prime and stand by!
Closer in.
We'll show those pigs who refuse us recognition.
Steady.
Stand by to fire!
Steady.
Mr. Farragut.
Yes, sir?
Break her aloft.
Aye, aye, sir.
Hold your fire!
Run up the parley pennant, quick.
Quick!
She runs the parley pennant, sir.
All stations stand fast.
What do you think, sir?
That he wants to talk, Mr. Farragut, so we'll talk.
There's little choice.
Let me go!
Let me go!
So you're privateers?
You're pirates.
You're black-hearted pirates.
Redell, take her below and lock her cabin.
Aye, aye, sir.
Now, Mr. Farragut, shall we go back to the war?
Make fast for parley.
Aye, aye, sir.
Make fast for parley!
l am the captain of this ship.
You wish to talk?
You speak bravely, Captain.
Perhaps because you know your safety is assured.
l know of no agreements concerning me.
You are wise, Captain.
Secrets should be well-guarded.
No doubt it serves a purpose to have you at sea, but in the future, it should be wiser to identify yourself sooner.
My men live for the cannon's roar.
Until we meet again.
Full half turn and all sail.
All hands remain at battle stations.
l don't know what it's all about, but it looks like the last of them, sir.
l wonder, Mr. Farragut.
l wonder.
This narrow escape has made me realize how wrong it was to keep you aboard.
When our provisions run out, l shall return you to the islands.
You'll be safer there.
So the pirate captain returns me to Del Prado.
l should not be surprised.
Del Prado?
Are we to pretend that the Governor General of the Spanish possessions in the lndies is unknown to you?
Believe me, Countess, l know nothing... l cannot.
l've seen too many of your sort while imprisoned at Foxardo.
lt is for your safety alone that l must return you to land.
Must we continue this playacting, Captain?
There's nothing you can say to overcome your actions.
ln that case, l'll be blunt.
ln a fortnight, our provisions will be gone, and l'll return to the islands.
At that time, you'll be free of us.
And Del Prado will hold you high in favor, be assured.
l'm truly sorry that you think so ill of me.
She wants no part of it.
She told me so.
The Countess also told me other things.
What other things, sir?
She mentioned a Spaniard named Del Prado, Governor General of the islands, close in contact with the pirates.
Yet we've seen no pirates, Captain.
The Countess has, at Foxardo.
All banded together and giving up plundering the shipping lanes, but for what, Mr. Farragut?
For what?
That gold from Brazil.
Exactly.
ln some way, they're working with the Portuguese.
That's why we got off with our lives today.
But you say this Del Prado's Spanish.
They have no part in this quarrel.
Our rations will last us a fortnight and no more.
Then, l'll be justified in returning to shore for supplies.
Course east by nor' east!
East by nor' east, sir.
l think we'll find the answer to this mystery of the sea on land, Mr. Farragut, at Foxardo.
Ah, my good Captain, how does it fare?
l have news of great importance.
More so than you will find in that book.
You are wrong, my friend, for in the books are the answers to all of Man's problems, and you have a problem, dear Captain.
lt is written all over your face.
l encountered pirates.
Pirates?
Why was l not told that some of them were still at sea?
But Captain Scarjack assured me...
Nevertheless, the pirate flag was flying.
Only my quick thinking prevented bloodshed.
l have given no orders since you left weeks ago.
lf that is so, then why... You say they flew the pirate flag.
That is strange, for l have kept our bargain to the letter.
l was about to board her, for she flew no colors.
Then, as we came in contact, the skull and bones rose from her mast.
You spoke to the Captain?
Yes, but he told me nothing.
l did not press the point since our crew is not in my confidence.
Furthermore, l believed him to be under your orders.
This Captain, did he speak your tongue?
No, he spoke the language of the American colonials.
He's ready to speak, my lord.
Bring him forward.
Perhaps my lndian brother is convinced that telling the truth is much easier than a visit to the tower.
Speak out.
Where is she?
What does he say?
She went aboard a ship that had stood by for provisions.
The men spoke a strange language that she understood.
So... Take him away.
l wondered how the Countess escaped me, Poulini.
Now l know.
She was aboard that ship you encountered.
What makes you so sure?
Since her escape, no other ship has touched these shores without being searched.
Hello, Del Prado.
l wish you would not address me so.
lt does not look well.
l will try to remember, Count.
l'm glad you're here, Captain Scarjack.
Poulini claims he encountered pirates.
Pirates?
lmpossible!
They flew the pirate flag.
And l say they are not pirates!
Every pirate ship in the Caribbean is at anchor, waiting for the word to move.
Then, my colleagues, they are not pirates.
Also, they are not Brazilians, or they would have left these waters when the Countess came aboard, yet they stay.
Then who are they?
Unless l am mistaken, they are the American Navy.
Sailing under a pirate flag?
This confuses me, l admit, but if they are concerned with us, they will return again.
You see, Poulini, the answers are all in the book, and, as Homer says, Man's mind, when tempered with time, will return to the scene of the crime.
We will wait, gentlemen, patiently, for our American friends.
Good evening, Mr. Farragut.
l hope l'm not intruding.
Well, Countess, this is a pleasant surprise.
Your cabin door's been locked so long, l thought you'd thrown away the key.
lf you had knocked tonight, you would have found it open.
l wish to talk to you alone.
Now that's a change in tactics l approve of.
There's quite a bit l want to say to you and very little time to say it in.
Then we sight land before long?
By this time tomorrow.
And am l still to be put ashore?
Those are the Captain's orders.
Don't judge him too harshly.
l know he feels it's for your good.
To be delivered to Del Prado?
You'll be delivered to no one.
l'm to go ashore and find your lndian friends.
l wish l understood you better.
At times, you seem of gentle breeding.
You're considerate.
You're kind.
You make me feel as if l can turn to you for help.
You can.
Then try to show your Captain l'd be safer here onboard than put ashore.
And if l try, will you do me one favor in return, no matter what his answer?
Perhaps.
Then if you have to leave this ship, and only then, wear this medallion around your neck.
To what purpose?
Say as a bond between us, until l can prove my good intentions.
Guierre.
A ship you sank, perhaps?
There's no dishonor attached to it.
lt's brought me luck.
l hope it does the same for you.
You're most convincing, Mr. Farragut.
l hope the Captain finds you that way, too.
But since we know he's involved with pirates, why not fight him out in the open?
Our orders read to find, not fight, the pirate fleet.
Your present missin is to search for food but, more importantly, to learn just where these ships are anchored and if Del Prado leads them or protects them.
And if l meet Del Prado face to face?
CAPTAlN: Tell him... Tell him that we know of his plans and hope to aid in their fulfillment.
Explain that you've been sent ashore by me to find out if he welcomes our proposal.
Point out that we'd be a fine addition to his ranks.
What about the girl?
You've convinced me, Mr. Farragut.
The Countess will remain onboard until l'm sure she'll meet no harm ashore.
Thank you, sir.
But please remember, should you fail in the missin, expect no help from me.
My job is to save the ship.
l understand, sir.
Oh, Mr. Farragut.
Yes, sir?
Good luck.
Thank you.
Join me, gentlemen.
The wine is superb.
l drink with my own kind.
Now, what is it you want?
l see, my dear Scarjack, that our social levels will never be joined.
However, l have news.
The so-called pirate ship has returned, as l said it would.
Her sails have been sighted.
She should drop anchor before long.
Good.
l'll rake her bottom.
Oh, no, Scarjack, you will not rake her.
You will leave the ship and the crew to me to dispose of as l see fit.
You're daft.
She'll make a grand prize.
You seem to forget that l'm still an official of the Spanish government.
My country is at peace with the American colonies.
But what do you suggest?
Plans have been brought to me by my agents in Havana.
They contain the sailing date, armament and course to be followed by he Brazilian ships in their run from Rio to London, also, a point marked well on the map where we will intercept them.
And soon, l hope.
My men are growing restless.
They've been holed up too long on shore.
We still have time, my friend.
Time we'll use to dispose of our American friends.
You will then be free to sail with the knowledge the Brazilian ships will not be warned.
l'll drink to that with pleasure.
Help yourself, Captain.
Remember, once the gold is secured, we no longer need the protection of the Portuguese.
l will take care of Poulini.
Good.
And one thing more, my friend.
Only you and l will know the place of interception.
l suggest we remain friends, or eventually the entire Spanish armada will breathe down your dirty neck.
l'll not cross you.
To my King, whose supreme generosity allows you to share in the prize, for helping get back what is rightfully his.
Of course, Poulini, drink up.
Drink up.
Ready to shove off?
Yes, sir.
Remember, find out what you can, but don't risk the men.
l'll do the best l can, sir.
Don't worry.
She'll be here when you return, and, Mr. Farragut, l'll be here, too.
Shove off.
As before, Mr. Link, and on the double.
Supplies can wait, Davey-lad.
We got company.
Gonna do something about it?
Yes, l'm going to hear what he has to say.
You are the leader of these men?
l am.
Then, seor, you will tell your men to come with me.
And if l choose not to?
That would be a mistake.
We're to be taken prisoner?
Not prisoner, seor.
We merely want to ask some questions about your ship.
Very well.
l'll leave a guard for the longboat.
l will leave the guards.
Now, shall we go?
Link, that ambush means they know something's up.
You've got to get back and tell the Captain to sail away before it's too late.
What'll you do, being left behind?
We'll figure that out later.
l'll not leave you, Davey-lad.
You'll go back.
That's an order.
l'll get you loose as soon as l find a chance.
Buck.
Jack.
All right, get set.
Take care, Davey.
Herd them into the castle.
Ahoy, man afloat off starboard rail!
Can you make him out?
No, sir, but he's plugging to us.
Heave him a line.
Aye, aye, sir.
CAPTAlN: Haul away.
Bring him up.
What happened?
Those Spaniards knew something was up and ambushed us.
Davey picked a fight to spring me loose.
He told me to tell you to sail out of here before they get the ship, too.
Get him some rum.
We're out of rum, sir.
Wouldn't you know?
Go on, get out of here.
They left two guards at the boat on the beach.
They took the rest of them back to the castle.
l'll get some boys and go after them.
We can't go after them.
You mean you're gonna let Davey rot in that place?
He knew the risks.
Sure he did, like the time he took the blame during the storm.
lt was my life he saved by turning the wheel.
l was pegged to the side while sneaking some rum.
There, l feel better for telling you.
Captain Porter, she's gone, the Countess.
We checked the ship.
She's nowhere aboard.
Are you sure?
Positive, sir, we looked all over.
lf she's jumped ship, there's nothing we can do about it.
But Davey... l can't endanger the lives of the men.
Well, then how about volunteers?
l'm sure the boys would rather fight than let their shipmates rot in a cell.
You realize a raiding party is in direct violation of my orders?
Yes, sir.
That l could be court-martialed for landing armed men on the soil of a friendly nation?
Yes, sir.
All right, let's go.
Mr. Redell, get me some powder fuses and flint rock.
Watchers, lower the boats.
The rest of you draw arms.
Well, Mr. Link, you're probably witnessing the end of a long and honorable naval career.
Yes, sir, but what a way to go, sir.
Ooh!
So my young friend feels better, huh?
l don't believe l've had the pleasure.
Then allow me to introduce myself.
l'm the Count Del Prado, Governor General of His Majesty's Spanish possessions.
Del Prado?
Yes.
You speak as if you've heard the name.
No.
No, l was just trying to see if my mind still functions.
Mmm.
lt was a silly gesture to try to escape like that.
There was no need for such heroics, you know.
Now, shall we talk?
Who are you and what is your missin?
l sail a ship.
We haul cargoes.
And fly the pirate's flag.
This l know, but who are you really?
Who flies the pirate flag but pirates?
l have never heard of such men from the colonies.
Even colonials have a price.
A profound observation from one as young as you.
The ship l sail is well-manned.
We seek a charter.
Perhaps, if l am convinced, there is a task l would... Let me go!
Let me go!
Let me go!
Let me go!
She was caught by the guards, swimming ashore.
Obviously not contented with life aboard your ship, Captain.
ls that true, Countess?
Was the Captain's treatment that bad?
He is no captain, and if he were, l would have still freed myself.
So you're not the man l seek, after all.
Place yourself in our position, Del Prado.
lf we are accepted here as friends, the Captain has ample time to come ashore, and if not, he can just sail the ship away.
What happens to you if he sails away?
Chances one takes in this professin.
l was uncertain as to the reception you would afford us, but now that our defenses are down, we can talk.
Ask the lady about us.
She was onboard when the pirate flag was raised.
ls this so?
Yes.
He and his men are the breed you do business with, and l want no part of them.
l imagine this is yours.
l was in the Spanish Court when the Guierre was sold to the Americans for the specific purpose of becoming a naval officers' training ship.
The purchase was widely heralded to all Spanish subjects as a token of our friendships.
Or do you wish to tell me you pirates attacked American men-of-war, too?
Now, who are you?
Very well.
You will have a short time to decide that telling the truth is less painful than the tortures of my chamber.
Take them to the tower.
Guards.
Davey, did Del Prado tell the truth?
You're not pirates?
We're American men of war.
Our missin was to break up this conspiracy.
And l betrayed you.
You couldn't know.
l could have trusted you and did when you gave me the medallion, but then l overheard you talking to the Captain and thought you meant to hand me over to Del Prado, so l escaped.
To this.
l'm truly sorry, not for myself but for you and your men and the failure of your missin.
We knew the risks.
You didn't.
So many times l wanted to explain but wasn't able to.
l understand.
A little late but still in time for all my doubts of you to be resolved.
And all your questions?
Answered.
So far, so good, Captain.
Signal the boats to come ashore.
Aye, aye, sir.
Pull them ashore.
All ashore, sir.
Spread the powder along the edge of the footpath.
Aye, aye, sir.
What time does the guard change at the castle?
l guess he doesn't savvy us, Captain.
We'll just have to cut his head off.
No!
No, no, seor.
l tell.
The guard, it change again at the midnight time.
How many in the guard?
Twenty.
Sometimes less.
You see yourself as they ride to castle.
And l know just where we can observe them from.
Tie him up.
Aye, aye, sir.
Powder set as ordered, sir.
Good.
All ready to go, sir.
All right, Mr. Link, let's have some shore leave in Foxardo.
Follow me, and keep a sharp lookout.
Through experience, l have discovered that the ancient methods are most effective.
l venture that, in future times, more ingenious devices will be used in gaining confessions.
However, for the present, this will suffice.
Unpleasant, isn't it, to share all this with other political prisoners?
Since your crew have not the detailed information l seek, it is you l turn to.
Very well, then.
We will proceed, huh?
l'm afraid there's a limit to nobility, even for Americans.
Guard change reporting.
Dismount.
Tie and gag him.
Quiet now, until we find out where... That's where!
Let's go.
l wish you could share this drink with me, my friend.
lt would refresh you.
lt is not my nature to be inhospitable.
l apologize for your discomfort.
Now, may l ask again what your missin is?
Bring her here.
Look there.
Look there, l say.
Maybe this will convince you once and for all, my friend, that l mean to get the truth.
Now, do l get the information, or must the Countess face the rack, too?
You patriots are all alike.
Resist to the last.
CAPTAlN: To the very last!
You're Del Prado, l presume.
l am the Count Del Prado, Governor General of his... That's all l want to know.
Take him.
Are you all right?
Yes, thanks to you, sir.
Mr. Link, you're hurt?
No.
l feel just fine.
l mash 'em.
l muck 'em... Beckett, take care of Mr. Link.
He has a bellyful.
Let's shove off.
All right, let's move out.
Open up.
But it is past time.
The gates remain closed after midnight.
This is special detail.
They lie!
What is the cause for alarm?
They have kidnapped the Count and ridden towards the beach.
Follow me.
Everybody in the longboats!
Hurry!
That'll take care of them till we're ready to fight.
l doubt that they'll fight with the Count onboard.
We can rest easy for a spell.
You have committed a great blunder in bringing me here.
l represent the Kingdom of Spain.
You also represent a pirate fleet.
The King may not approve of that.
He'll know such charges are a lie, unless you can furnish proof.
You'll furnish it yourself before you leave this ship.
l'll not say a word.
Very well.
Mr. Farragut?
Yes, sir?
l take it we're still masquerading as pirates.
Therefore, l suggest we act out the end of this drama.
Run out the plank.
Aye, aye, sir.
Run out the plank.
Aye, aye, sir.
But surely you can't be serious about this.
l'm too deeply involved to stop short now.
Blindfold, Mr. Beckett.
This'll keep you from seeing the sharks.
Bosun, pipe the plank.
All right, walk him down.
Captain Porter?
Yes?
l submit.
Mr. Redell.
Aye, aye, sir.
Untie him.
Well?
This map, it tells of the pirates' rendezvous with the Brazilians.
Thank you for your cooperation.
Now, l demand to be put ashore as quickly as possible.
So you will be.
The moment we reach our fleet base in Charleston, l'll escort you ashore personally.
Mr. Redell.
This way, Your Highness.
l'll have you broken from the service, l will.
These documents are to be handed over to the proper authorities in Charleston.
lt appears, Countess, that your fleet will have a safe crossing, after all.
For a while, l was afraid he wouldn't talk.
For a while, Mr. Farragut, l was more afraid than you.
Oh, Captain Porter?
Yes, Mr. Farragut?
l just wanted to say thank you, sir.
Weigh anchor!
Hands, make sail!
Braces and sheets!
Take her as she fills.
Set course north by northwest for Charleston.
A fine cruise, sir.
'Tis a shame for Lieutenant Farragut it might end so badly.
After what l've done, l've a feeling the court-martial will be mine.
Davey-boy's grown up.
Yes, Mr. Link.
l daresay this cruise on the Essex has made us a man.
The End @
On this map, all the territory indicated green is known as an act "Louisiana Purchase," the area that is Pres.
Jefferson bought from Napoleon.
Today covers a large part of even 15 States, and even the part of Canada.
The area is more than twice greater than the original 15 states.
But with this purchase, inadvertently came the infamous pirate, sea robber, Jean Lafitte.
If you were a little patient, ladies and gentlemen, could increase the pleasure in a film that you will see, if you know why the Jean Lafitte ... and his little insular stronghold in Barataria Bay, near the mouth of the Mississippi River, were so important for both sides in the war 1812th whatever.
Nadiruaa English army knew that they will control New Orleans give control over the entire course of the river Mississippi and bring certain victory.
England command stressed access to New Orleans the river is not an option.
But this network of water roads, you see here, called branches, which is controlled by Jean Lafitte, was the rear entrance in New Orleans.
Both the British and the Americans they knew Lafitte the key.
And what this pirate do?
This, ladies and gentlemen, our story.
MARINE robbers Jean Lafitte, the last sea robber and still lives in the immortal words of Byron: "He left a pirate name other times- connected one virtue and thousands of crimes. "
Three U.S. President condemned, stroked and again condemned the pirates.
But Fate has put in the hands of this man without a country, the fate of one, United States, which fought for own existence in the war 1812th I.
.. ...
Experienced defeat after defeat.
Now Only one man stood in defense, to prevent a deadly Scorecard shot uneducated general, the name of Andrew Jackson, with acicom hunters the squirrels and inexperienced recruits.
Come on, boy.
Over here.
No you will not do nothing.
You must be hungry.
Will one cookie?
Come on, boy.
Certainly good.
Better not look at the dog, than a rifle, soldier.
Place it in your hands.
You are English?
If I had, you would be dead.
How long were you in the military?
From the day before.
Well, boy, how do you feel?
A bit hungry.
You're not hungry until your stomach not cleave along Kiem.
Hang on now that musket.
How long have you been with Old eagle face?
I am old Eagle face.
You?
Andy Jackson himself?
The thought and me sometimes scares.
How did someone like you get this task?
Now I can relax, right?
More krpa damn boots?
Better them than your feet!
Andy, you're not coming here, since you sent me to wander and gather people in this chill.
I know, I know.
And you know, this is more difficult to tolerate when these bones weaken.
Sit down.
Here, have some fine hot soup.
Thank you, Mr. Peavey!
Inside the waiting one officer.
Came and see all the way from Washington.
Why did not you say so?
He did not say it was an emergency, only official visit.
What's the news?
To ease, Captain.
Captain Wilkes, I come in the name of President Maddison, sir.
The English won Washington.
They burned the capital and the White House.
The President is safe?
He got away, sir.
But the next few weeks, government will be monitored from President's saddle horse.
We pray that this horse does not stumble.
The fate of the country in your hands, General.
England invading fleet sent to New Orleans.
On ships have 16,000.
16th ..?
They expect them to stop S. ..?
Here we have 1,200 people, and most of these boys does not shoes, let alone a man.
How do I ...?
New Orleans?
Obviously here we have more chickens, but soldiers.
Move it.
Let's see.
If you control the Mississippi, will keep this country by the throat.
Maybe we could set up a defense here.
And there.
Not there.
Why not you?
It's Barataria.
Each piece of the swamp controls Lafitte, the pirate.
From New Orleans to the Gulf.
First we have to agree with him.
Agree?
With a pirate?
What kind of deal, We will hang him.
Trying to hang him already 10 years.
When Andy talks about hanging, you should see a rope.
JEAN LAFITTE provides a rare opportunity without taxes MARKET seven seas.
Go ahead, scroll.
All you welcome to the market Jean Lafittea.
Without taxes.
No additional charges the war was lost.
Come on, we cleaned the deck.
Well, what have you got there?
Gentlemen, this is a real Spanish lace!
How exciting!
It looks like it's from the harem.
So- you will not feel like a sultan.
Take care of gentlemen.
Gentlemen, what is life without the right spices?
Me personally this is the King of France asked to sell on his behalf.
Apparently the King of France has a bad taste.
Ma'am, this is a fine piece of the picture.
He just needs a little polishing.
What, you do not like children?
Mobi, eaerna cane.
Pickpocket.
Mobi!
eaerna cane.
Hello, General.
When you steal the sea, Then you sea robber.
When you steal the land, then you are a thief.
Mobile, Mobile, eaerna cane.
Excuse me, sir.
I you dropped your wallet.
Thank you!
I did not expect that the pirate ... What?
I wanted to say, thank you.
General Dominique?
Good afternoon, madam.
I brought you something as a souvenir.
Oh, that's nice.
Thank you.
For beauty, honor.
It gave me the car in Austerlitz.
General, you should not have.
Really should not have.
Bonnie, give me the money, not belong to either you or your father.
Move it.
You know that half every dollar goes Lafitteu.
Just try to take it, I'll rip your belly.
Look, Bonnie, half belongs to the boss.
Keep your claws out ocevog of cargo!
If you were not the daughter of Captain Brown, I'd ... You what?
Bitch one!
Who pushed Bonnie?
I am.
Move, Dominique, I'll kill that filthy squid.
Dame can not beat with a broken bottles.
I do not have a sword.
Bring it on!
It was Jean Lafitte!
Go get 'em!
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the end of our little show.
We hope you enjoy the show.
Let it be just a hint of what, we went through, we find brought treasures Seven Seas.
We take the risk, and you bargain.
Thanks, Lafitte.
Thank you, Mr. Lafitte, exceptional performance, as always.
Thank you all, gentlemen.
Hey!

Why not nauci handled scissors cutting as you handle a knife?
Governor's daughter.
What you think you doing here?
You do not think came to buy?
Miss Claiborne!
Good day, madame Mercier, I'm glad to see you.
Let's go guys, run it.
Now everyone can show appreciation, so a little more open wallet.
Goodbye.
My dear, we are very honored your distinctive prisutnoau.
Better not tell her husband where you purchased this scarf.
Mr. Lafitte, never say.
Actually her and you can not blame him.
He's a pirate.
You'll see why my hands are tied.
Sales of goods without taxes, signed by Jean Lafitte.
How to gather taxes, when half New Orleans business with these pirates.
There must be a way, they are breaking the law.
We can not arrest the whole town.
It is true that, in fact, nobody cares.
Nobody wants to pay taxes in a war that we are losing.
If you think so, sir.
Phipps, maybe you need to resign.
I am a loyal American, sir.
Okay, okay, we have Lafittea today in shackles.
Annette.
I did not ask to fall in love with you.
After I first saw you, I had thought to be 4 months knowing that we'll be out of sight.
Neither typhoons or hurricanes, and not could erase from my mind.
And you came back here.
What I thought might be just a dream, you've done stvarnoau.
Now you say it's over.
Jean, my father is here sent to the President, to this country brought a kind of unity.
And I, behold, there in love with a man, which can destroy all that my father is trying to build.
Who, me?
Yes, you.
I feel like I'm on the side of the enemy.
Half my people we are jumping the neck, because they do not allow attacking U.S. ships.
Love for you it cost me a lot of money.
Jean ...
It's not about what you do not do, already about what they should.
We are losing the war.
Englishmen just burned Washington.
What does it matter to us?
New Orleans might be next.
New Orleans had three different Flags in the last 15 years.
It does not matter what will be and fourth.
It is important to me.
You do not know what it means belong to a country.
You want a country?
I'll give it to you.
You can have Barataria.
Barataria?
Barataria's kingdom a thousand fighters.
Ships that sail Gulf and Caribbean.
Do you know what they offer King of Barataria?
$ 500 dead or alive.
It will not charge it.
Jean, a girl must be proud on his love, do not be ashamed of it.
How can I tell people that I love man, who is the head of a price?
You're just not ... What did not?
Say it.
You are not worthy of respect.
Worthy of respect.
What do you want the code weapons, not a man.
I want a man with a feeling of honor, duty and loyalty.
Not savages.
-Savage you was not good enough, when you needed breath of fresh air in your boring social life.
My life may be boring, but 'barato' continues means cheap.
I think it's better to get back to the carriage.
Too late, gentlemen.
Just You missed a good opportunity.
Hooch, set the best archers on those trees.
Blue, cover the bridge.
We can take them, boss.
No shooting.
I do not want trouble.
Come on.
Quick!
Now you will see, Governor.
I swear, sir, there are people Lafitteovi maintain sales an hour ago.
I know, I know.
I'm glad, Governor.
You look funny, sir.
Governor, you I did not expect!
Obviously, madame.
Can you explain, Ladies and Gentlemen, why do you find in this beznacajnoj swamp, hands full krijumcarenih things.
Even my own daughter.
Excuse me.
Father, I ... You're looking good bargain, Miss?

Looking for something special?
I ask you!
Mr. Phipps?
Yes, sir.
Read my manifesto.
I'm offering $ 500 reward to capture Jean Lafittea.

That's new.
Dead or alive.
William CC Claiborne, Governor Louis'.
I, Jean Lafitte, I offer 10 thousand dollars Hearing Governor Claiborne.
Lieutenant!
Capture this man!
Carefully, Governor.
You are not at home.
Governor!
One hundred guns were directed to you at this moment.
It is better not to take risks, Governor, people can get hurt.
Just the fear that someone of you to be hurt, inhibit me that this pirate immediately brought to justice.
Sir, I'm a pirate.
Pirate.
You laugh!
I just laugh!
Did not realize that your country is at war?
Will you laugh and when the British march, and you you do not have any State or the flag?
And you!
Will you laugh when General Jackson rides and expel you and your koljace out of Barataria?
And others have tried before.
It will be differently with Jackson.
He swore to you that there is no places under the American flag.
I'm truly sorry to hear that, Governor.
I've always respected American flag.
Miss, are you coming?
I'm not looking for trouble.
While with me, she's a lady.
It's a lady!
Come, come, fix I will you.
You're next.
I do not know how to swim.
I've got to get him out.
Cowards.
There were days when I could handle ten of these at once.
If you were not so drunk I would beat you up.
Okay, okay.
These punks down there!
Who are you yelling?
On you!
Now get out before than you send patrol.
Who do you nare?uje?
I was a ship's captain before you.
Get down!
Come on, fatty.
Stop it, Paul.
Come on, I'll fix you, too!
Shut up, Paul!
Stop it, honey.
These rats here they first began.
Yes, he would not hurt a fly!
They insulted my lady.
You must be blind.
This monster, lady?
Who are you calling ... Get out of that and do not carve.
Mr. Brown, you will allow to discuss this with me?
Bonnie is right.
You monster.
Erase.
It is a case with the lady.
Come on, Paul.
You should have seen me, Bonnie.
Arranged I have four of, yet I used fists.
Why do not you use the on Lafitteu?
Instead of those rats.
I'll choose the time.
Come on, let's go have a drink.
And, no, you will not.
You've got sloshed.
Only one.
Get back to the ship.
Here comes another one.
Everybody stand back.
Be careful.
Keep them away from the line.
Sale.
Come on, Paul.
Before you gets in your mouth.
Come here.
Look at that.
U.S. ships that Lafitte never attacks.
And what happens?
All Gold from New Orleans He slipped through the hands to those Yankee falcon.
Lucky charm.
Buy lucky charm and long live.
Passengers for Corinthian, Embark.
Take care, boarding burden.
Just a little, please.
You can not let them.
Yes, sir.
But now it's all yours, Captain Carruthers.
Sign here and download governor consignment for safekeeping.
I'd rather have the burden of cobras, but the devil's bait.
Already has enough trouble with the lock.
Maybe you mist be walked on hand.
Mr. Miggs.
You just give us a few minutes?
Yes, sir.
Good.
Give a signal to visitors go ashore.
All visitors to the coast.
I never thought I'd you see that keep a child.
I wish you luck.
It will take me.
Marie!
Annette.
What are you doing here?
I found a message that you left your father.
You're coming home with me, now.
Sorry, Annette.
It goes with me Spain.
We'll be married.
Stay out of it, Antonio.
Annette, manage fathers life, but do not mine.
She will not listen to reason, Antonio, maybe you will.
I talked to your father, says that we need to wait until the war is not to wind up.
And I I will not wait!
Stop, think only upon himself.
It makes no sense to talk with her, Antonio.
He knows all about how to be a lady.
But nothing about it how to be a woman.
You're probably right.
Ah, Marie.
Annette, please did not think so.
Very nice, but ... Annette, I'm sorry.
It should not be so separate.
Annette, I'm sorry.
It's okay.
If you do not want to sail with us, you must leave.
Okay, now I'm leaving.
Okay, you two, I'll figure out How do I tell my father.
Beware it.
Look, just do not thought.
Will you catch cold!
Visitors to the coast, sail.
I wish I could be at your wedding.
Annette, I had time purchase wedding dress, so I borrowed your new dress.
Which one?
What you sewed Madame de Dupre.
Of white crepe?
I'm sorry.
Annette!
Yes?
I took my mom and brooch!
Did you leave me anything?
Yes, father.
Then, Rumbo?
Have you caught that the Portuguese galleon?
The English is the first docepali.
And you Flint, What did you catch?
Ten pounds of iron in the trunk.
Well that did not sink.
The boss does not like him Captains of returning empty-handed.
We will convene Captain's Council ... boss may not be long head.
It is time to ask few questions Lafitteu.
Sure you want to respond?
Maybe they get.
Trouble on the horizon, Pyke.
But why stay in Barataria?
Listen to me!
Jackson We send out comes.
And the English blockade We were there close.
And you do not give us immersed U.S. ships.
I say, let's send 100 boats to sink, pick up values ?
?and let's go to New Orleans, before Jackson arrived.
I agree.
Jean, listen to their captain.
We the people must, back to him.
Now we have more dealers from the beach, but the pirates.
What impedes us to stay in Barataria, and roll back to Jackson?
Our children were born here.
Hut on the beach is the only home which many will know.
If we go from Barataria, I'll lose Carribu.
And I'm Tina.
Sailor's home is deck beneath his feet.
And why are you wearing a bag French country around the neck?
This, Mr Pyke, reminds me of all the lies, to talk about the country.
Majcica country, fathers country, country.
All this is just a country, which will bury you.
A shed blood defending it.
I say that belong to the sea.
Man belongs there, Where do you want to belong.
I do not like when I push against.
Neither Claiborne nor Jackson, or Englishmen or more!
Wait, I want to say something.
Here, Miguel.
I forgot.
Boss, may I speak?
Already has enough unimportant been told.
This is Scipiov home.
Just say it.
I know the law, boss.
I can not dislodge.
Law?
What law?
I do not remember, sir, boss?
I was told, The law on human rights.
Ah, there it is.

We are equal in Barataria.
Silence!
I want to hear the rules.
Continue, Scipio.

Inalienable rights.
Thank you.
-What are these rights?
So to give them no one can take away!
While no one came with more artillery.
That's it!
Okay, okay!
Thank you, gentlemen.
Continue, Scipio!
Life, liberty and the achievement of happiness.
It is better than ours Law Fraternity.
We tell no guarantee happiness.
None of these rules is not for us.
They are Americans.
Barataria The U.S. is, is not it?
Of course!
As long as we this pile of sand, we have all the rights that we guarantee.
Nobody has the right to evict.
That's right, boss.
Nonsense!
Of all of these bljezgarija Freedom and rights me sick.
He says he wants to stay and be Americans.
Do not lie, said to you.
This is the only America, to which he cared.
He's right.
Stay out of it, Bonnie.
My father was the best water you've ever had.
And while all of you are here chatting, He went for cargo, valuable quarter of a million dollars in gold.
What are you talking about?
For months there was no ship Treasure at a distance of 150 km.
Gold transferred from New Orleans, right in front of you.
The only ship that sailed from the port last week was Corinthian.
Sailed before two nights.
Corinthian?
He the U.S., boss.
No one shall order my father who ship to attack.
Least Lafitte.
My father had his own fleet, while you fought for scraps.
No longer betray orders, Lafitte.
Now it works Captain Brown.
Flint, Captain Rumbo, on their ships.
Slowly, Jean, quarter of a million is a significant prey.
We will follow the one who returned.
Right.
I'll take Ravena and crew'll congregate on the beach, if I have to.
Jean, you're still the boss.
And I I still assistant.
I do not like to miss a good fight.
Just pray that Retrieve your father, before it touches the American ship.

Gramby?
You're his assistant.
You had a hand in this?
-He received I have orders from his captain.
Your captain more will not issue orders.
Jean!
You can hang them all.
I guess I do not keep the entire crew responsible for the actions of one man?
I'm not so wide of the heart as a general.
Then, Gramby?
Brown or follow me?
You.
You ... what?
You, boss!
All right.
Hang him.
Gramby, do not!
Jack, Tiny, deacon, hold.

Full sail.
Positions!
All in their places!
Spread your sails!
Beluche, signal Raven let go of us.

I now feel that the a saint?
A saint who will save us?
It's a boy with Corinthian!
From looked at him, I get chills.
He is the only witness all that.
Too small to throw back.

And why not share booty on the beach, as always?
Do not provoke trouble today, because you'll pass as Brown.

Do not!
Come on, boy!
This dork is a Corinthian?
Your friend Brown left two survivors.
Boy and his dog.
Come on, son.
Well, at least the dog can talk.
Coming reason do not share the spoils.

Do you need help, General?
No, it is not necessary.
Too seen.

Are heard of Brown?
Yes.
Hello, boss.
Would you like shrimp?
Hold it.
Let her go, Beluche!

I am.
She could not hit a boat with an ax.
Dirty, smelly killer.
Your father got what he deserved.
People under my leadership consuming burden, not lives.
It is all that remains of crew and passengers with Corinthian.
Brown killed everybody's right to fall under the U.S. flag.
Only one flag for rights all of us, black as your heart.
He did not even slightly care for your people.
Just for the chance that you lost the governor's daughter.
Bonnie is right.
We are not interested to become Americans, like you, Lafitte.
We are interested only division of spoils.
This little one is between us and a quarter million in gold.
Listen, Lafitte.
One language is as bad as the 20 more You, sharks, are you hungry?
It is simple.
Lafittte to become America, we want to share the gold.

I have prepared you a carriage.
Thank you, Cato.

If you're going to feel better if hurt me, go ahead.
Jean ... Loving you, most important thing in my life.
Please believe it.
Annette.

Father.
What will people think?
About what?
You left out Mercier the guest list.

You should meet with General Jackson as soon as possible.
I announce our engagement.
I'd be thrilled.
What did you say?
Do not be a coward, tell him.
She I'd be thrilled, Father.
Do we have to yell at each other?
Why are you standing there?
Oh, stung my hand on a thorn.
If we reach agreement with Lafitteom, maybe we should be hanged pirate flag in the city.
We're not here for discussion Reputation Jean Lafittea!
He offered his assistance and waiting for our answer.
Respond cannon.
Before I surrendered to the English, but given the land into the hands of the rabble.
At least maintain their dignity.
General Jackson will need men and ammunition.
Lafitte We offer both.
On the battlefield, General do not ask who delivered bullets.
I completely agree with the Governor!
At Jackson's place would rather have a deal with the Devil.
In any case, here we have decide on the authenticity of these letters.
That is not the question.
You believe that fake?
Not enough are authentic.
Only proven to work with the English.
Renegade is, I do not believe that he was a traitor.
You think Lafitte waived 30 thousand and position in the British Army, Just because, in order to become a U.S. citizen?
You would not, Mr. Mercier?
Gentlemen, I agree with all the put, but we can not ignore the opinion our esteemed governor.
We are wasting time.
Give me an order to throw Lafittea of ??Barataria!
You have my vote!
Mine!
Solve at least one enemy.
Gentlemen, gentlemen!
Consider this.
Lafitte is one of the best hope, that this country has.
Gentlemen, we can not agree.
Vote.
You know what, chief?
Already the I feel appreciated.
What do you think, Pyke, what chances for people to be with us.
Just tell me how you want to vote.
We're not so, Pyke.
From now on, everything must be democratic.
Maybe a little friendly persuasion, but democratic.
Boss!
Englishmen.
They waited.
Pyke, can you see someone to find.
OK!
Calalou!
Calalou!
Calalou!
You're back where you started, Lafitte?
There is no one to listen to your orders, except mosquitoes.
How are you British missed?
English?
Your American friends We were visited.
You lie like a dog!
See ...
Recognize U.S. uniform when I see it.
We fired at them, but We Dominique prevented.
All called them out docekaju, klicu them.
Sing "Yankee Doodle."
Then we resort exploded in his face.
Does someone pulled?
Some fled to the swamps.
Some were put in chains, to be hanged.
Dominique was right!
No one can believe that.
Oh, how I've waited for this moment, when I'll see you broken, defeated.
Now when I see it, it hurts.
-Don't give me your pity.
More I liked your hatred.
Where are you going?
New Orleans!
I'll wring your people from jail if I have to kill the Jackson.
No!
Do not go in New Orleans!
Because if the Americans do not kill your own people will.
We ourselves go to Cartagena, perhaps to Galvez in the Gulf.
Why do you care What will happen to me?
Because you're a part of it all, I ever loved.
I hated it.
Very nicely sung, Ms. Claiborne.
Thank you.
Thanks to you, my dear.
This is my favorite song Rachel.
You gave me a feeling of home.
It's the least we could do make for a brave soldier, who came to defend our city.
Not to mention the beautiful ladies, that adorn it.
Thank you.
I want to assure you, sir, that hearts and homes of the city open to you and your people.
I am very grateful, ma'am.
I can assure you that we will Defend your city from danger.

Keep a cool head.
Mr. Peavey, Colonel, Major Reed.
General, is expected to defend New Orleans with this ... poor more trained people?
My troops are trained to fight, not for show.
But they lack guns, gunpowder and ammunition.
But no heart for a fight.
We have think of our homes, families.
It seems that you have to think at all, except at home.
Brave words, but you can not they shoot down the enemy.
We'll stay alive only if we surrender.
I'll be very clear, gentlemen!
Before I give this city, I will burn it to the ground.
General Jackson, we have the right decide on their own fate.
You'll discover that we have strong civilian government.

More bark than bite you!
Ready to fire?
Ready, sir!

Fog is too thick to see anything.
Can we somehow stop These missiles, General?
We do not have enough gunpowder, to spend it on missiles, Governor.
Only create confusion before than go on the attack.
They tried the same and in Bladensburg.
General, arrived Lafitte and his men.
Thank God.
Where are they?
Come from the swamp.
A little late, Mr. Lafitte.

There was no command to fire.
These flares create too noise, silence we them.

I would not say, General.
See where they come out of the fog.
That could be seen in the Shoot, my people would have already been shot!

Just relax, guys.
Mr. Lafitte, make sure your People do not shoot until they are well see the target.
Muskets are of effective over long distances.
Add me spyglass, Mr. Peavey.
If not for this damn fog My long-Kentucky them blew 100 meters before the shoot.
What is the range of your Guns?
Range?
These beauties all hit squirrel the eye to almost 300 meters.
Then you just need to know when they come into range.
I would not say that we will send the English signal.
-The English would not, but I do I want!
Tired of life, Mr. Lafitte?
I'll go with you, boss.
No, you're too big a target.
Mouse?
Yes, boss.
Got powder with you?
Yes, boss.

I do not hide it.
Looking for friends.
I bet you do not do you know anyone here.
Ah, I know!
My A friend of Mr. Lafitte.
Where did you meet him?
It's a big secret.
I've never watched so.
You're not the Jean Lafitte.
What are you afraid?
I'm afraid I see anything!
See?
I bet the Whistle does not work.
I do!
See?
Let me fuanem.
No!
You know what, if you go to call my friend Mr. Lafittea, I'll give you that trying some.
What I'm going to tell him?
Just tell him that Miggs here and that it wants to immediately see.
So ... good.
Beware this for me and do not eat any.
Marjorie!
Marjorie!
Stop it.
Where did you get it?
From my friend, Miggs.
It seems that someone won.
Inherited his mother's charm.
I can not say that someone named Miggs sounds appropriate for zeta.
Miggs?
Miggs ... Hello, my son, what is the news about my friend, Captain Thomas with Corinthian.
I do not know, sir.
Wait a minute.
How did you get so quickly returned?
Everyone thank you very much in this tribute.
There is another man who he deserved to get these same honors.
He brought me three things, necessary, in Chalmette: Flints for muskets, Gunpowder and brave people.
Ladies and Gentlemen, Mr. Lafitte.
Once again, my personal gratification.
You know, for a man who has spent most of life was spent in an unstable deck, rather slow dance.
The trust generals, dancing I always causes seasickness.
Ms. Claiborne, nice you like a princess.
Thank you, General.
That's my Rachel here We showed you Rural dance steps.
I wish I was there for you, General.
I am too.
General Dominique, I see that you have an eye for beauty, as well as for artillery.
General Jackson, I want you present this lovely lady, Miss Bonnie Brown.
I'm glad, Miss Brown.
Perhaps you will interest, Miss, I was recommended by General for its exceptional contribution to the struggle.
Thank you, sir.
Excuse me, Bonnie.
General?
I have to admit something, I do not want to lie General like you.
See ...
I was just ... Actually, I was only distributor.
Well, I've seen the fight General, my friend.
I am very grateful.
Thank you.
Miss Brown.
Something is wrong with your hand?
Yes, Miss.
She needs your beautiful hand.
Come on, Bonnie.
This is like a fairy tale.
Yes, is not it?
Is not that right, Jean?
Yes, it is ... how much we still have to stay?
Not for long.
You're lucky, Annette.
This is so romantic.
You have to bring the bridegroom at my house for dinner.
With pleasure.
Lucky you man, Lafitte.
On the contrary, sir, I'm the lucky one.
Well, see you soon, very soon!
Do not you think we already exposed long enough?
Maybe I am, but you're not.
I want every woman in the world be jealous of me.
Annette, we can see the ring?
Of course!
I can not do it!
Bonnie!
All you have to say is 'Congratulations'.
I smile.
That's enough, let's go.
I'd rather him smash bottle on his head.
My general!
Jean, Miss Claiborne.
Miss Brown barely waiting to congratulate you.
That's it.
Good luck to both of them.
Thank you, very kind of you.
It is a fish that is hard catch, Miss Claiborne.
Yes, it was not easy.
What are you looking at?
Something wrong with my clothes?
Not at all, you look good.
You're gorgeous, the dress is beautiful.
Did you know that the same kind of madame de Dupre made for me?
But she's my sister took the Corinthian.
Corinthian?
Would not that be embarrassing, both wear the same clothes?
Proof that tailors never be trusted.
I hear a waltz.
Miss, I insist that I tribute dance.
Excuse me.
Of course.
Jean.
I did not want.
Jean, I'll go from here.
I will solve the dresses, I'll burn it.
No one has ever will not see it, I swear.
Will it revive her sister?
Annette does not have to know.
You could say that the Corinthian sank in storm, was lost at sea, who would know?
I'll know.
What are you going to do?
Tell her.
You're a fool.
You'll lose everything you've loved and for which you have fought.
You gave up everything you had, all that you are.
Jean, I do not even want see how far you lose.
Would you be able to love a man, who killed your sister?
I could love a man who killed my father!
Mr. Lafitte, there was a boy who you want to see.
It's called Miggs.
Where is it?
-There, with your dog.
Tell him that I was waiting behind the house, right now, you know?
Is it really your friend?
Yes, of course.
Go now.
Go back, wait for me there with Miggs.
Jean, I'm afraid.
Go!
Have Miggs.
Maybe we have to fight for output, boss.
To call people?
No, I would not be fighting.
Listen up, everyone.
Go to Raven.
Prepare him to sail.
I will come if I can.
You're not going to come to terms with this without me.
Dominique, this is an order!
If you do not I come to two hours sail.
You heard the boss.
Come on.
Something is very odd.
Boy refuses to answer.
How do we expect to match, when all vicete on it?
Annette was right.
Listen, son, no you will not do nothing.
We just want to know how you left Corinthian?
How did you get back?
Corinthian yet could agree.
I do not know ... was night.
Spread your wings and flown?
Stupid!
You did not fall overboard?
That's right, sir!
I fell over.
How did this happen?
Tell us.
There was a storm, big waves.
There was no storm, my son.
Yes, it was!
And there have been big waves ... Is the ship sinking?
What?
No ...
I do not know.
I know what you'll get to tell the truth.
For God's sake, Mercier, do not raise your hand to a child.
I put a quarter of a million dollars that ship and I'll find out what happened.
Wait, Mercier, ship is certainly sunk.
Were they British?
No, sir.
Was he Lafitte?
Mr. Mercier, how dare you?
Mercier, do not stand at my porch and the amount of such charges!
If you were British, then who is?
Mr. Lafitte was not even there!
He was ... Lafitte was it?
Mr. Lafitte was ...
He's what?
I can not answer that question!
I was there.
What?
Corinthian is submerged.
Were there any survivors?
All but one were killed.
Have you participated in fact, Lafitte?
I was their boss.
Mr. Lafitte!
Mr. Lafitte, I just come say hi to you, I did not want this to happen.
Mr. Lafitte!
Jean!
Hang the murderer!
Jean, tell them it was not you!
You would not believe it.
Mr. Lafitte, I did not want!
No need for arbitrating!
Hang him now!
Bring the rope!
Father, stop them!
You want to defend this killer?
Father, he did not do it, I can guarantee life.
And what is the life your sister?
Father.
G. Peaky.
G. Peaky.
Call General Jackson, tell him what you intend.
Do not worry, honey, I'm going for him.
Hurry!
Switch rope over!
Not here!
Hang him on the street, where it belongs.
Wait!
Nobody criticizes this man, as I do.
I lost my daughter.
But you can not take the law into their own hands.
Lafitte himself outlawed!
Yes!
I'll be happy to see him hanged, but not from the wild crowd.
Turn soft to associate with him.
Give it here!
You're insane!
Behave like animals!
By God, I'll kill the first to be moved!
This city is still under state of emergency.
How does this apply the killer?
Responsible for the death of 80 people ...
Silence!
Lafitte, are you sunk the ship?
I was responsible.
I risked myself Wealth on Corinthian.
What have you risked to front, Mr. Mercier?
Jean has offered to assist in the defense of our country, and you have destroyed Baratariju!
And yet we came to help.
It's not about that, Miss Claiborne!
That being said, sir!
I gave a promise to this man.
A full pardon for all his man, who join me on the battlefield.
He gave his word.
I'll keep mine.
I will keep you in word, General.
I'll meet up with one Clock advantages.
Release him.
Okay, Lafitte, Your clock is started.
Jean!
I'll go with you.
Annette, what kind of life we ??have?
Without a country, without a home, without belonging icemu.
We belong to each other.
You are the whole world that I want.
Annette, you do not know what meant to spend his life on the run.
I want to live and die with you.
Jean!
Too much love, that I'd brought with me.
What you can bring the memory of you.
I can not give you back your daughter, you lost to Corinthian, Governor.
I can give you back what I love most in the world.
Lafitte!
No corner of the world, where you'll be safe.
At least leave all of you safe.
In the American New Orleans.
Keeps the wind in your sails!
You'll hang the flag?
We do not have flags.
What course?
The open sea.
Keep the wind in the stern.
Where are we going, Dominique?
Where it belongs.
When a man loses everything Others, still has the sea.
This deck is the only homeland we have.
It's all homeland I want.
Want gas, mister?
Yeah, fill it up.
Help yourself, will you, please?
I gotta close up.
To you know how to get to Blackbeard's Inn at Godolphin?
I'm goin' there myself.
I'll show you the way if you'll give me a lift.
You're on.
Thanks.
Stayin' at the inn?
Yep.
Mostly old ladies live there.
Salesmen goin' through like to stay in Ye Jolly Roger down in town.
Got more of a chance to kick up their heels.
Well, I'm not a salesman.
I'm the new track coach at Godolphin College.
Coach, I'm glad to know you!
My name's Gudger Larkin.
I'm on your track squad.
I'm captain.
Well, well.
Small world, isn't it?
Let's see now, Captain.
I'd guess you were a sprinter, huh?
Golly, no, sir.
I'm-I'm as slow as molasses in January.
Can you give me a hand, Coach?
Oh, yeah.
Say, what is your event, Larkin?
Oh, I'm the shot putter, sir.
Shot putter?
Well, the weight man's usually the strongest man on the team.
Yes, sir.
That's the inn, Coach.
That's Blackbeard's Inn.
Did the old pirate really build it?
Sure.
He got killed in a battle right out there in the bay.
I guess I'll have to brush up on the local history.
Wait till you meet the little old ladies who run the inn.
They're all descendants of Blackbeard's bloody crew, and they're proud of it.
"Buccaneer Bazaar tonight.
Help save Blackbeard's Inn".
What does that mean?
Some guy's trying to have the inn torn down... but the old ladies are putting up a pretty good fight.
You sure they haven't started to tear it down already?
Well, I'll tell you, it's built mostly of odds and ends.
Timbers of ships that got wrecked in the bay.
You can park over there.
All right.
What's that all about?
Hey, buddy, I... That's Silky Seymour.
He runs the gambling around here.
I wouldn't fool with him.- What's he doing at the old ladies' bazaar?
He's the guy that bought up their mortgage from the bank.
If the old ladies don't come up with the loot, out they go.
This fellow Seymour gets everything he wants around here, huh?
Just about.
Miss Jeffrey, have you seen Miss Stowecroft?
This gentleman has a room reservation.
She's outside in a tent telling fortunes.
Dean Wheaton.
What is it?
Sir, I-I'd like you to meet our new track coach.
Steve Walker, sir.
Just arrived.
I believe I'm to report to you in the morning.
Uh, Welcome to Godolphin, Mr Walker.
Thank you very much, sir.
I don't want to seem negative, but I want to be frank.
I was not in favour of replacing our former track coach when he left so informally.
Oh?
For some years now, the track team has done precious little... to add lustre to the name of Godolphin College... so there didn't seem any point in going on with it, you see?
Well, I'm sorry to hear that, sir... Howsoever, we have competed... in the Broxton Relays for the past 63 years... so the alumni insisted on one more try.
Well, of course, sir, there's not much time left before the relay is here... but I hope I can restore your confidence in the boys.
Mr Walker, I never had any.
Well, mmm, before the warmth of the dean's reception goes to my head...
I think I'll find Miss Stowecroft and get a room.
I've been on the road since 5:00 this morning.
Okay, Coach.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Gudger... uh, what did happen to the other track coach?
I don't know.
He got to actin' real weird.
Talkin' to himself, real down in the chops.
And one day, he just disappeared.
Just... and he was gone.
Good night, Gudger.
Good night, Coach.
Oh, Mr Walker.
This is Mr Purvis... our football coach, whom you undoubtedly know by reputation.
Well, I certainly do.
Who doesn't?
We're very fortunate in having the services of Mr Purvis.
He produces winning football teams... which in turn produce gratifyingly large grants and endowments from proud alumni.
Mr Walker is the new coach of what we refer to as the track team.
The track team.
Oh, Walker, you won't last three weeks.
Take my word for it.
Well, if you don't mind, Mr Purvis, I'd like to find that out for myself.
A word of advice, friend.
At, uh, Godolphin, the name of the game is football.
That's what makes the mare go around here, so, uh... Football.
Don't get any big ideas.
Wouldn't dream of it.
Oh, well, come along, Mr Purvis.
I'm sure that Mr Walker will acclimatize very quickly.
Track team!
Miss Stowecroft?
Sit down, Ishmael.
No, my name's Steve Walker, Miss Stowecroft.
I believe a room was arranged for me here through the college.
You know, living accommodations?
We accommodate the living.
But who shall accommodate the dead?
Give me your hand, Ishmael.
Oh, no, no, no.
I don't want my fortune told.
Just a room, Miss Stowecroft.
There's a revelation here.
Dark deeds and violence.
Things roused up that were better left to rot.
If you'll tell me where the keys are, Miss Stowecroft...
I'd be happy to...
Hold.
There's more to the revelation.
We see good here too.
Oh, well, that's good.
Happiness.
Happiness and content for the people of Godolphin... delivered from an ancient evil, and gratitude to you, Ishmael... Oh.
Who have sacrificed your own life... in their delivery.
Now the light fades.
That is all.
Now, about the room, Miss Stowecroft... That's all.
Yes, but... You may leave an honorarium... for the care and welfare of the spirits in the bowl on your way out.
Oh, thank you.
Come again.
Hi.
Hey!
What's the big idea?
Well, kisses, one buck, right?
But I don't work here.
Can't you read?
I'm executive committee.
I work here.
Well, now, so you do.
Well, that is what I call a real good dollar kiss.
Plenty of value for the money.
Would you hold this a minute, please?
How would you like to try the five-dollar special?
Five-dollar special.
May I have my badge?
Thank you.
Oh, no, I'm terribly sorry.
Only one to a customer.
Excuse me.
Oh, Miss Stowecroft.
If I could get that room now, please?
Oh, Ishmael!
Come along, please.
The auction is about to begin.
Ladies and gentlemen of Godolphin and neighbouring community... you all know the purpose of this bazaar.
Our good friends, the Daughters of the Buccaneers... took over this old ruin many years ago and turned it into a cultural landmark.
They serve tea, cooked chicken dinners... even turned part of it into a boarding house... anything to keep it going, but that's not enough.
And unless enough money is raised tonight... this place that has been their home for so many years... will pass into the hands of strangers.
So, when Miss Stowecroft begins to auction off... the treasured mementoes, the fine antiques and the family heirlooms... that these good ladies have so generously donated to the cause...
I beg you to search your hearts and to bid cheerfully... boldly and very, very generously.
Thank you.
Miss Stowecroft.
Thank you, Professor Baker.
Lot number one.
A fine antique pistol... which has been in the immediate family of Miss Emily Jeffrey... past president of the Daughters of the Buccaneers... for many, many years.
Now...
Uh, one dollar.
Oh, can't we do better than that?
Who'll give me $20?
Do I hear $20?
Oh, the gentleman in the back just waved.
The gentleman in the back says, "$20."
Who'll give me $30?
Thirty dollars.
Thirty-five dollars.
Forty.
Fifty dollars.
Sixty dollars.
Seventy.
Do I hear $80?
Eighty dollars!
One hundred dollars!
One hundred dollars bid!
Do I hear 110?
Professor Baker, how about your nice young man in the back?
Oh, I don't think so.
He just backed into his shell.
Very well.
One hundred dollars once.
One hundred dollars twice.
Sold!
All right, move in.
One hundred dollars.
Thank you.
Lot number two.
A genuine antique... You got taken, buddy.
This is a fake.
Copper-bottomed bed warmer.
Take my advice.
Don't bid on anything else.
I think well over 250 years old.
You mean the warming pan is fake too?
That's tourist junk.
And Mr Seymour don't like to see you throw your money away.
Ladies and gentlemen... this bed warmer is believed to have been the property of Aldetha Teach... tenth wife of our dear Captain Blackbeard.
And now, what am I bid?
If you want to bid, go ahead, but, uh, I don't think Mr Seymour would like it.
Mrs Starkey, how about starting the bidding for us?
N- No, thanks.
I, I don't think so.
How about you, Mr Finch?
Oh, uh, no, no, thank you.
Uh, Mr Harrison, you'll open the bidding for us, I know.
This pistol's enough for me.
Oh.
Will no one open the bidding... on this magnificent item?
Five dollars!
Well, thank you.
Ten dollars.
Mr Virgil Purvis... our football coach, bids $ 10.
Fifteen.
Twenty dollars.
Twenty-five.
Thirty dollars.
Thirty-five.
Fifty dollars.
Fifty-five.
Sixty.
Sixty-five.
Seventy!
Five!
One hundred dollars!
As we all know... Mr Virgil Purvis, our football coach, doesn't like to lose.
He very generously bids $ 100.
Just an opinion, but I wouldn't bid any more if I were you.
Are there any other bids?
Well, now, why is that?
No reason.
I just don't want you to.
One hundred dollars going once.
Oh.
One hundred dollars twice.
Two hundred dollars.
Two hundred dollars once.
Two hundred dollars twice.
Sold to the nice young gentleman in back.
Now we're really rolling!
Excuse me.
Lot number three.
Here we have a fascinating piece from colonial times.
The clock in the gentleman's stomach keeps perfect time.
Now, what am I bid?
New around here, aren't you?
Yeah.
Do I hear $20?
Just passing through?
Nope.
Thirty dollars.
Might stick around a while, huh?
Thirty-five dollars.
Might.
Thank you.
We'll see each other again.
Fifty dollars.
Good night.
Eighty dollars.
Hi.
Hi.
How'd you make out?
Fine.
Much better than we expected.
Thank you.
That's good.
No problem, then?
Oh, I wish that were true.
We still have another $38,000... to give Mr Seymour before the first of the month.
Say, why is Mr Seymour so anxious to get his hands on this property anyway?
Here, I'll show you on the map.
You see, this is... this is the island we're on.
Well, in Blackbeard's time, the river flowed this way.
And the inn wasn't on an island at all.
It was part of the mainland.
Then about, oh, 80 years ago, we had this terrible flood and a storm... and the, uh, the river changed its course... isolating the inn from the mainland.
As a result, nobody's ever been able to clarify... what the legal jurisdiction of the island really is.
Th-That's where Mr Seymour comes in?
Sure.
He can tear down the inn, put up a big, modern casino... and the law can't bother him.
Mm-hmm.
Oh, uh, well, I'd like to thank you for what you did tonight.
You know, without you, we wouldn't have had much of an auction.
Well, I just kept bidding because it made you smile.
I like that smile.
Jo Anne, aren't you re...
I've been waiting to drive you home.
Excuse me.
Good night.
Good night.
I'm going to put you in his room.
I'm sure he won't mind.
He?
Captain Blackbeard.
Oh.
This looks out to the river and to the upper bay.
Oh, the captain used to stand here for hours with his spyglass... studying the ships moving in and out.
He'd pick out the one he liked... then he'd come here to this very table... and with his men, he'd plan how to seize it.
Well, thank you, Miss Stowecroft.
I know how anxious you must be to get to bed, so...
Sometimes when he's in a bad mood or feeling lonely... we hear him thumping around, breaking glasses and bottles... trying so hard to communicate with us.
I suppose we should all be very angry with him for all that noise.
But, you know, it isn't his fault, poor man.
Then, whose fault is it?
Aldetha's, of course.
Who?
Number ten.
The captain's last wife, but one.
Oh, the one your warming pan belonged to.
Oh.
Well, good... Aldetha was a witch, you know.
She never forgave the captain for denouncing her to the authorities.
When they were burning Aldetha at the stake... she put a terrible curse on him.
As the flames crept higher and higher... she screeched her dying words: "Edward Teach, sometimes known as Captain Blackbeard... "when you come to die, may your body and soul... "be racked between this world and the next... "always to be alone.
"May this curse hold fast and true.
"May you dwell forevermore in limbo... "or until such time as there be found in you... "most wicked of all villains... some spark of human goodness".
Well, good night, Mr Walker.
Sleep well.
The dining room will be open for breakfast at 7:30 am.
Oh, please be prompt.
Oh, no.
Two hundred bucks.
"Aldetha Teach".
Well, so the thing did belong to her.
"Her book of spells and conjurations".
Well, now.
"A spell to turn your enemy into a spotted toad".
"A spell to turn mercury into gold".
I wonder if there's a spell to make a track team out of a pig's ear.
"A spell to bring to your eyes and ears... one who is bound in limbo".
Well, how about that?
Limbo.
Curses.
Pirates.
Malarky.
Blackbeard himself was a phony.
He was probably some chicken-livered little pipsqueak... that built up a reputation scaring old women and children.
Chicken-livered pipsqueak, is it?
A remark spoke slighted like that... could raise a man's blood now, could it not?
I've been on the road since 5:00 this morning.
I'm just tired.
Nothing to eat.
Miss Stowecroft gassed me up with pirate stories.
I'm all right.
I'm just tired.
Boy, am I tired!
I don't think you're real.
I don't think that sword is real!
And I'm gonna walk right through it and go to bed!
Try it, mate.
It's real.
Who called me out?
What?
Who invoked me?
Aldetha's writing.
No!
Aldetha done it.
"Beware," cried me shipmates.
"Sheer off.
That girl, she be a true witch".
And I paid no heed.
Oh, Aldetha.
To do that to your legal spoke husband.
Oh!
The story is, Blackbeard had her burned.
Burned?
I never put a taper to her.
Never.
Oh, I own that down in the horse latitudes, on a dull day...
I might've keel-hauled a wife or two, or else walked one off the end of a plank, yes.
But I never did it for spite.
Funny thing about me.
Never did it for spite.
I might've done it out of, uh, jest... to keep the spirit of me shipmates up.
And now to real business.
Where'd you stow it?
What?
What?
Your rum.
I don't drink.
Don't drink?
Ship's stores.
Have to seek succor there.
Ah, Mrs Stowecroft, your humble servant.
Servant.
A bottle of rum No glasses are left I'll drink from the bottle with you, sir You don't know what you're missing, son.
She didn't see you.
Aye?
She didn't even hear you.
Oh, why should she?
I'm a kind of a ghost, you know.
In limbo, caught twixt this world and the next... beholden to that spell which brings me to your eyes only.
You mean, no one can see you except me?
That's about the shape of it, son.
And that's why I'll be sailing alongside of you, see?
Wheresoever thou goest, there also will I go.
So let's drink to that.
Are you sure you don't want to freshen your spleen?
Now, let's get one thing straight!
I want nothing to do with you!
I'm go...
I'm gonna go to bed... and you can go back into the woodwork or wherever it is you came from!
Belay that tongue!
One thing old Blackbeard don't take kindly to... it's them sort of "insinuendos".
Come to think of it, I don't care for the cut of your jib, neither.
If I were to lay this course, I'd choose myself a companion... a hearty companion, with a little blood on his sleeve... and a predilection for rum, for song... and for the occasional wench.
But what have I got?
Hmm?
I've got a shindly little beanrake.
Now, wait!
Yes, I have.
With the shakes and the whimpers.
What do you mean the sh-shakes and...
Doesn't even want to join me in a drink.
We're stuck with one another, you and I.
The cruise may well be a long one, so you'd better make the best of it.
And I take this opportunity of bidding you a very good night.
Hey!
Hey, wait a minute!
Get off of my bed!
Your bed?
My bed!
"My bed"?
I captured it from a Portugee trader at the sack of Cartagena!
I spitted him clean and sweet against the headboard!
Well, I... Don't rush me.
There it is.
There's your Portugee, what's left of him.
Well, if you think I'm gonna sleep on the floor, you've got another thing coming!
Oh, well then, welcome aboard and drop your hook.
Devil is the man whoever said that old Teach was inhospitable.
All I ask is to be able to get to sleep, because I know... because I know that when I wake up tomorrow morning, none of this will have ever happened.
Nine men... Down!
Oh, when nine and twenty Spanish lads You pull it on the sheets, my boy Up!
The Jolly Roger!
Wind freshening, aye, Mr Bellamy.
El Portugee, it's your daughter I'm after, senor, not your bed.
Don Mendoza, we meet again.
Pick up your weapon, sir.
Take my regards to the king of Spain!
Bellamy!
Oh!
That's it!
That is absolutely it!
Figment of my imagination or no figment, he can have his room.
He can have his bed!
I don't need it.
I'm going to the Ye Jolly Roger Motel where the salesmen go.
Well, nothing like a little fresh air to straighten you out.
For a while there, I almost believed there was a pirate.
Oh, no.
You're back!
Right?
That be about the measure of it, lad.
I fear there's no way of being rid of dear old Blackbeard.
Well, that's great.
That is just great!
I couldn't have an ordinary ghost on my hands!
I got a rummy!
A big, ugly, booze-soaked rummy!
Hold on there!
There be no call to put the fuddler's name on your new-found shipmate.
Uh, look, lad...
I've been very lonely, see.
I'm just an old hulk, wrecked on a lee shore.
All my shipmates gone, no one to listen to me no more.
You don't care for me, that's plain as print.
Shut up, will ya?
Shut up.
Ju-Ju-Just shut up.
Aye.
Aye, aye.
You wouldn't have such a thing as an handkerchief... on your person, would you?
I don't have a handkerchief.
Oh, you must, do you?
Keep your hands to yourself!
No!
What manner of craft be this we're cruisin' in?
What?
This craft.
Oh.
It's an automobile.
Aye?
An automobile!
Oh, is it?
Yes, "automotonees".
Yes, "autosomonees".
Hey, sit down!
It's propelled by some kind of animal under the hatch, is it?
No, it isn't!
Sit down now.
Hey, what do you think you're doing?
I've a mind to have a hand at the helm.
Well, you've got another mind coming!
You're gonna kill us, you idiot!
Take your hands off the spokes... or I'll bend a marlinspike around your loaf!
I'll take that wheel.
I haven't finished my turn yet.
Wait!
Get away from there!
It's my turn.
Get your hands off the wheel!
Feels like a weather helm, don't it?
I'll show her who's master!
No!
No, no!
No, no!
No, no!
No, no, no!
We're in the breakers, boy!
Get out!
Back the main braces!
Stand by to wear ship now!
Take your foot off of my gas!
Look out!
Read about.
Hard alee.
Hard alee.
Avast, ya lubber!
What are you doin' in the main channel?
Oh, no, not a policeman!
Let... Let go!
Let go!
Look, I'll give you the wheel later.
Right now, I... You've done it now, you dumb ox!
Steer out of the whirlpool!
Man overboard!
Your driver's licence, please.
Who's the popinjay?
Will you stay out of this?
Well, Mr Walker, I see we've been out getting our nose wet somewhere tonight.
It so happens, I don't drink.
And what is that on the seat beside you?
It looks like a bottle of rum.
May I have it, please?
I believe you're right, Mr Walker.
It is a bottle of rum.
Let the swab find his own rum, I say!
Will you give me this bottle and stop maying a nuisance out of yourself?
I'll take charge of that bottle, if you don't mind.
You let go of the bottle, you idiot!
No need for epithets, Mr Walker.
I'm only trying to do my job.
I'm afraid destruction of the evidence isn't going to help you any, Mr Walker.
Now this be the foulest crime of all... wasting good spirits.
By thunder, this raises me blood!
No, don't do it!
There's no need for you to get emotional about this.
You've had the fun.
Now you can take the consequences.
All right, lad, all right.
I shan't harm him.
But this gentleman needs a lesson in manners.
It's plain to see that you're starting to come apart at the seams.
All itchy, twitchy, talking to yourself.
Cut it out, will you, Blackbeard?
All right, get out of the car!
Hey, watch that thing!
It's probably... Hey, look out, will you!
Five balls in one load, mate.
Five!
Many's the time off the Maricaibos...
I could've done with a prime little darling like that.
Give way, you landlubber!
The key, you idiot!
The key!
Turn off the key!
Think you can get away from me, do you?
Calling Patrolman 9, we're at the corner of... Hey, lad, that be better sport than riding a humpback whale in a hurricane!
Hey, care for a drench, son?
It'll brighten your scan.
You're still here, huh?
Aldetha's testament, I see.
Studying some way to get rid of poor old Blackbeard, are you?
How'd you guess?
I have been observing thee... and I note that you have a bent for getting yourself into trouble.
I get into trouble?
Oh, that is really rich!
Who do you suppose put me here?
Well, do you think I like this mortal life of yours?
Aye, there doesn't seem to be any honest joy any more.
Your modern life of yours seems to have got small.
Everything's puckered up.
You call this a four-poster bed?
Clear the way there!
I'm down.
You won't get no comfort out of that.
If it's Aldetha laid that spell, you can mark it a good one, without no loophole.
Now, wait a minute.
Mrs Stowecroft told me that curse.
Something about you having to dwell forevermore in limbo.
Limbo.
Then something, something, something... Until there be found in you some spark of human goodness.
What's the matter?
Aldetha was bright as brass.
She knew me like a book.
Well, you must have done something good.
Did you ever... Did you ever pat a dog?
A dog?
Yeah.
Pet it?
Yes.
No, I never did pet it.
Did you ever help an old lady across the street?
That's silly.
Anything?
No.
No.
No, we're sunk, you and me.
Dead as pork.
Might as well... face up to it.
Hey.
Hey, the little old ladies, the Daughters of the Buccaneers.
Your own kith and kin, some of them.
Give them your treasure.
My treasure?
Yeah.
The one that people have been talking about for so long.
It's hidden somewhere around here, isn't it?
Never mind.
Eh?
Why should I give them my treasure?
Why, you great ape?
Because you can do some good with it.
You can help them.
In helping them, you might help yourself.
You might break the curse.
You thinks this, does ye?
Yes, I thinks this.
If you help those little old ladies save their home... they'll name public schools and bridges and highways after you.
Can't you see it?
Teach Park.
Teach Highway.
See?
The Edward Teach, uh, Memorial, uh, Free Day Nursery.
Free?
For babies.
Oh, for babies.
Yeah.
Named for me, a wicked old pirate?
Yeah.
And for nothing more than a few chests of doubloons and a few strands of precious jewels?
You bet they will.
And in spite of the fact... that I've got the blood of a thousand gallant lads still on my hands?
Will you forget the blood!
I mean, I'm trying!
Look, crack loose with the treasure, huh?
It's the only way.
Well, it don't sound right to me.
Of course it doesn't sound right to you!
How would a creep like you know the difference between right and wrong?
That's why the curse held on so long.
Now, come on.
Where's the treasure?
Well, I suppose I must trust you.
Yeah.
Where is it?
The treasure?
Yeah.
Want to know the treasure?
Yeah.
Hmm?
Where is it?
Where's the treasure?
There ain't no treasure.
There ain't... What?
No!
Not a penny.
There's not a doubloon.
There's not a bent or damaged peseta.
That is one of the most outrageous things that I have ever... Do you realize people have been searching for that treasure for over two centuries?
Huh?
Poor, unfortunate souls grubbing and digging in the dirt!
I'm not good for nothing!
I'm not, I'm not!
Grubbing in the dirt, old poor people there... Oh, don't start crying again.
Look, you must have saved a few coins somewhere.
Something?
No, no.
I did have a treasure.
Yeah?
I had a big treasure.
Yeah?
Lovely, I did.
Yes.
I spent it all in one week... among the fleshpots and gambling halls of Port Royal.
Oh, it was a glorious week, that was.
You know what you are?
You are a 100% total loss.
You're not even a respectable ghost!
You're a phony!
Aye?
A phony!
Oh, I've run aground.
If you ask me, the guy was stoned.
I say get rid of him.
The police report said they released him for lack of evidence.
It says, "Although the atmosphere at the police station... reeked of cheap rum, the test showed no trace of alcohol in his system".
Oh, he probably figured some cute way to neutralize the booze.
Pills or something.
Science is doing all kinds of stuff like that these days.
Well, there's a corollary.
It says that Mr Walker spoke loudly to someone in his cell all night long.
Well, there's nothing wrong with that.
It happened there was on one in the cell with him.
So he's either stoned or he's nuts.
Either way, who needs it?
Professor, I left last night before the auction.
Did you notice anything unusual in Mr Walker's behaviour?
Yes, I did.
There.
You see?
When Silky Seymour and his cheap hoodlums scared the daylights out of everyone else... he is the only one that stood up like a man.
Now, wait a minute, Jo Anne.
That's not fair.
If I may remind you, Dean, the Broxton Relays take place next month, and our team needs its coach.
They need Mr Walker.
I still say we ought to saw him off.
This guy's not gonna come up with anything.
Just a minute, Mr Purvis.
Now, we have fielded a team in the Broxton Relays for the past 63 years.
We'll carry on the tradition as best we can with Mr Walker.
Well, I'm sure you won't regret it.
Oh, Professor?
Yes?
I realize that your field is child psychology... however I'd appreciate it if you'd keep an informal eye on Mr Walker's behaviour.
Oh, certainly.
It's the least I can do.
Thank you.
Mr Purvis, does it strike you as odd... that sooner or later, all our track coaches seem to crack up?
I can understand the others, but this one hasn't even seen the team.
Say, why has Fellspahr got his fingers in his ears?
That's...
It's on account of the starter, sir.
You mean he's...
Yes, sir.
Fellspahr is afraid of guns.
Th-The way I figure it, Coach, is we need more time to whip these boys into shape.
You don't suppose they could postpone the Broxton meet, do you?
No.
Okay, fellas, that's it for today.
Hit the showers.
Right, Coach.
Let's go, fellas!
You all go now!
Lots of spirit!
How fares your day today, eh?
As if I don't have enough troubles.
For a short, wonderful while there, I thought I'd lost you.
You know where I've been?
I've been in Godolphin Town... roaming the streets and shores of my young manhood... Yeah.
Soaking myself in nostalgia.
I know.
I can smell it!
And you know, as fate would have it...
I went down to one of these here gambling establishments... by name Silky's Place.
Hey, take off, will you?
I've got a lot to do.
And I overheard what some of the natives are saying... on this here subject of gambling, see?
Go away!
I mean it!
Now, if there's been one abiding passion in my life... it's been the pleasure of gold or silver coin upon a wager.
So when I heard that I could get 40 or... listen to this... 50 to 1... on the forthcoming enterprise of your young rabbits... Ooh, with all that... What?
You want your lads to win, don't you?
I can teach you how to do it.
Forget it!
Why should I?
I was a good hand at teaching young crews.
'Twas no accident, by thunder, I was known as the finest pirate... ever to sail the Spanish Main.
Or the Portugee Main either, for that matter.
Now you'll be asking yourself with some impatience, "Why was this?"
I'll tell you why.
I trained my men to win!
Win!
Always win!
By fair means or foul, by soft words and hard deeds... by treachery, by cunning, by malpractice... but always win.
You mean you have the unmitigated brass to ask me to let you train my team?
I'm not doing this for myself, believe me.
No.
I'm doing this for those dear, sweet old ladies.
Oh, yeah?
Yes, I am.
The little lavender-scented ladies, I like to call them... that stagger up their rickety staircases of the night... their lanterns held aloft when the lights got too bad for knitting by... and say to one another, "Ellen, where is our ship?"
Of which Blackbeard is captain.
"And which may never now come to port at all".
Never mind the snow job!
I feel just as sorry for those old women as you do, but that doesn't... No.
Yes, I do.
That doesn't give you leave to put your bloody paws onto my team.
Now, you stay away from those boys, you understand me?
If we win anything, which I doubt, we're gonna do it without cheating.
Without cheating?
Ha-ha!
You've never lived, boy.
You don't know what life is like.
Just go away!
Go maroon yourself somewhere, will ya?
Let me help you.
Go on!
Go on!
You don't know what life is made of!
Little old things... You see?
There he goes again.
Well, I don't know what his problem is.
But whatever it is, it's a beaut.
I take it your observations so far have been inconclusive.
Well, I can't tell if he's all keyed up over the track meet... or if there are outside pressures we don't know about.
L... Well, I just haven't been able to get a close-range view.
Pity.
Oh, I am having dinner with him tonight.
Ah, he asked you to have dinner?
Well, not exactly.
I asked him.
Do you think that's wise?
Well, it's entirely within my discretionary power... as head of the committee to welcome new faculty and students to Godolphin College.
Professor Baker, we don't have any such committee.
Well, we do now.
Oh.
Oh, yes.
Hello, Professor.
Nice to see you.
Mr Walker, so we meet again.
Looks that way.
Tell you what.
Let me buy you a good lobster dinner.
Afterwards, we'll drop into the back rooms and have a whirl at lady luck, huh?
Well, thank you, but, well, that's not likely.
Suit yourself.
There's no harm in asking, is there?
Leon, these are friends of mine.
See that they get a nice table.
Yes, sir.
This way, please.
Enjoy your dinner.
What's he doing here?
Mr Seymour owns this place.
I'm sorry, but it's the best restaurant in town.
How's the action?
I can't tell you how much I appreciate this.
Appreciate what?
Your suggesting dinner tonight.
That's perfectly all right.
The committee stands ready... to advise, counsel, and extend a helping hand to the newcomer at all times.
Yes, that's very nice.
Actually, I do need someone I can talk to.
I've had a problem for a couple of weeks now... and I've been afraid to talk to somebody because... they might think I was silly.
Well, please go on.
Thank you.
You see, it started the night of the auction.
I sat down on the bed to remove my shoes.
I was tired.
I wasn't paying too much attention to what I was doing... and I sat right down on that antique bed warmer.
I broke the handle right off.
Oh, well, you mustn't let that bother you.
Oh, no, it wasn't that.
No, I-I think I have th-the address... of a little shop down on Main Street where we can get it fixed.
No, Professor, wait a minute.
Wow!
What's the matter?
Aren't you afraid to carry all that around with you?
Oh, well, I'm...
I hate to leave it in the apartment.
I'm-I'm taking it to the bank in the morning.
It belongs to the Daughters of the Buccaneers.
Oh, oh, yeah.
The little old ladies and their mortgage.
I hope they're gonna make it.
Mr Walker, this is only $900.
Unless $37,000 or a miracle, preferably both... turn up by tomorrow night, midnight, those little ladies are gonna lose their home.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Say, uh, can't you borrow the money from the bank?
Well, not at the moment, but, uh, then we were talking about your problem.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, my problem.
Mr Walker?
Yeah?
Are we looking for somebody?
Yes, my problem.
Look, I know your first inclination is gonna be... boy, is gonna be not to believe this.
Hear me out, please.
Certainly.
Well, as I said, it was the night of the auction.
When I sat down on my bed warmer, that's when he first appeared.
He?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It was because of him I spent the first night in jail... and I haven't been able to get him off my back yet.
Well, is, uh, is he here now?
No, no, no, no.
I don't see him around now.
But I smell him.
Smell him?
Yes, he's got a breath that would stun a horse.
He's a booze-guzzling old cutthroat, and he's latched onto me as his buddy-buddy.
Well, uh, does he have a name?
Well, I mean, who does he claim to be?
Blackbeard's ghost.
Blackbeard's ghost?
Yeah.
Well, how can you be sure he's the real Blackbeard's ghost, the ghost of Captain Teach?
Well, you ought to see him.
He's got whiskers, he's got a cutlass, he's got the whole bit.
That must be who I saw you talking to today.
Yes, yes, yes.
That's what I've been afraid to tell anybody.
I mean, they'd think I was nuts.
Oh, well, I don't think anybody would think that.
But you certainly do have a problem.
I've got a problem.
I've got a problem.
Oh, yes, you... Will you order now, sir?
Uh, yes, yes, thank you.
Madame.
Oh, thank you.
Our shore dinners are very good this evening, sir.
Well, that sounds... sounds good to me.
How about you, Professor?
Oh, the shore dinners are excellent.
Yeah, that's fine.
Fine, fine.
Uh, two shore dinners.
Very good, sir.
Now, would you like our special dressing on your salads?
That's fine.
Thank you.
Oh, please, go on.
Oh.
Oh, are you sure you want me to?
I mean, I don't want to bug somebody else with my problems.
Oh, no, no.
I want to hear.
Okay.
Uh, you were telling me how you first met Captain Blackbeard.
Right.
Where was I?
Well, you were sitting on your antique bed warmer.
Right.
The handle broke right off.
Do you know it turned out to be hollow?
I thought nothing of it for a moment, then I noticed... there was something rolled up inside... a dusty old paper.
I thought it was gonna fall apart right in my hands.
It gave me kind of a funny feeling.
Oh!
Oh, you poor man.
Waiter, did you hurt yourself?
I'm so sorry.
Oh, that's quite all right.
It's just a little water.
No harm done.
Will madame please forgive me?
Certainly.
Hi, Danny.
Hi.
You just missed the first race at Green Meadows.
Godolphin... to win... Nine hundred dollars.
They're in the starting gate now.
There's the rabbit, and they're off!
Coming past the grandstand is Pilsen leading the field.
Hello Baby is second... Come on, Baby!
Rainy Weather, third and Daddy Dumpling is fourth.
At the first turn, it's Pilsen by two lengths... Rainy Weather moving into second, Hello Baby and Daddy Dumpling.
In the back stretch, it's Pilsen...
This your bet, Danny?
Daddy Dumpling is second, coming up.
What do you think I'm standing here for?
Rainy Weather is fading.
Hello Baby is fading.
I hope you know what you're doin'.
Let me worry about that, will ya?
It's Pilsen... Be right back.
Hello Baby.
Oh, Mr Seymour, take a look at this.
Godolphin to win?
Who's the patsy?
Danny Oley.
Okay?
Listen, his money's as good as anybody else's.
Uh, what price are you making?
On this one?
Anything.
For an old customer like Danny, let's make it interesting... say, 50 to 1.
At the three-quarter pole, it's Daddy Dumpling.
Aunt Pavla is second.
Pilsen is third.
Dandy Andy moving into fourth.
It's Daddy Dumpling...
Okay, Danny.
Into the stretch it's Dandy Andy and Aunt Pavla... Daddy Dumpling and Snow Queen.
At the finish, it's Snow Queen, Aunt Pavla and Daddy Dumpling.
Winsome Lass to win in the second.
What's the matter?
You just made a bet.
Something closing in on you, Pops?
This is my bet.
Fifty on Winsome Lass to win.
Danny, don't you remember?
You bet Godolphin $900 to win the Broxton Relay.
I bet... Come on, will ya?
I wouldn't bet on Godolphin to start with the letter "G." Well, skipping all the-the technical language and getting down to the point, uh... I- I would say, if you'll ignore him, he'll go away.
And may I tell you something?
He's not so easy to ignore.
Oh, please try.
I know you can do it.
You know, Professor, sitting... sitting here with you like this...
I almost believe you're right.
I will try.
Bravo!
Now just say, "Farewell, Blackbeard.
Bother me no more".
Farewell, Blackbeard.
Bother me no more.
I like the sound of that.
But just in case that it doesn't work, may I feel free to call on you at any time?
Somehow, you give me a feeling of security.
Oh.
Well, certainly.
L... Well, there's no point in being the head of a committee... unless you intend to do your job properly.
How true.
Yeah.
Oh, no.
Sorry about the ice cream, madame.
Oh, it's quite all right... but, uh, I think I'll skip dessert.
Yeah, yeah.
Uh, just the check, please.
Here we are.
Uh, keep the change.
Thank you.
Shall we?
Oh.
Come along.
Excuse me.
Good night.
Good night, madame.
Good night now.
Thank you.
Uh, good night, ma'am.
Good night, sir.
Good night.
Good night.
How do you do, ladies and gentlemen?
Mel Willis here.
And welcome to Sports Spectacular... coming to you this week from Broxton Field... home of the famous national track and field event... the Broxton Invitational Relays.
Now, as you sports fans know... there are some four college teams represented here tonight.
At least three of these squads are numbered among the outstanding teams in the nation.
As for the fourth, little Godolphin College from across the river... Well, in the old days, the Godolphin track squad took a back seat to no one.
They had a great tradition.
But those good old days seem to be gone forever.
I want you to look at this event not as an ordinary track meet... but as a preparation for life.
Now, some of you are gonna be graduating soon.
You're gonna find the world out there full of nothing but trouble... frustration and... and strife.
And I tell you right now that nowhere will you find a better preparation... for that world outside than to be a member of this particular track team.
All right, it's time to go.
But I want you to know, no matter what happens out there tonight... in my heart, each and every one of you is a champion.
Let's go!
Oh, pardon me, Professor.
Oh, Jo Anne.
Nice of you to come.
We can use all the good wishes we can get.
Well, I certainly do wish you and your team good luck.
However, that is not why I'm here.
Oh.
You may recall that, uh, last night I placed the sum of $900 in my bag... and when I opened it this morning...
I found this in its place.
"$900 on Godolphin".
Jo Anne...
I appreciate the gesture of confidence, but you shouldn't have done it.
Mr Walker, in the first place, I do not bet.
And in the second place, if I did, I certainly would not embezzle funds... that have been placed in my trust to do it.
Well, then how did it happen?
Well, I believe you were the only person to know that I had that money in my purse.
It's that rotten pirate.
He did it!
Can you imagine, taking money meant for those little old ladies?
Well, someone took it.
Now I remember.
Now I...
Your purse went off... You don't think I did it, do you?
Well, you can't expect me to credit that story.
Well, Jo Anne, that's exactly what happened!
Besides, didn't you say you believed in the pirate?
Well, not $900 worth!
Besides, I believe in him as... as a-a metaphysical image... not some stupid, sticky-fingered goop.
Well, that's exactly what he is!
Hurry up, Coach.
It's beginning.
I'll be right there.
Okay.
Mr. Walker, I- I shan't bother you any more.
I want you to know that I understand perfectly.
Your motives were good, even though your reasoning was perfectly idiotic!
With the captain and the bottle You regard me strangely, son.
Something amiss?
You took that money.
Money?
Money.
Oh, the odd flimsy I removed from the purse of your, uh, bookish wench.
Why should that stir your ire?
Because it belongs to the little old ladies!
Now, lookee here.
You know as well as I do I replaced that money with a piece of paper... what will bring great wealth to them small old ladies.
Money in fifty-fold!
Oh, I can't trust no one.
I'll deal with this matter personally.
Wait a minute.
Just how do you figure to do that?
By bringing a victory in this sport event... which is taking place out there this moment.
Aha!
I told you once to keep... Give me that rubbing alcohol!
Hey!
Oh!
That's a dangerous move, me hearty.
That's not to drink, you idiot!
What are you trying to do, kill yourself?
Little late to think about that, isn't it?
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Let's get one thing straight between you and me right now.
You're to keep your grubby paws off of my boys.
You understand that?
I don't know what you're trying to do out there, but you are not gonna do it.
My team may not win out there, but whatever they do... they're gonna do it honestly.
Come on, Coach, will ya?
We've come in last in two events already.
Hands off.
You got that?
"Come on, Coach, will ya?
We've come in last in two events already".
Another bean rake.
All right, play it whatever way you like, ya puppy.
Get no help from me.
You'll come crawlin' back, you will.
I'll bring my boot to you, and I'll grind your mealy-mouthed jib... into the dirt!
I will.
Ladies and gentlemen, it's going just about as I predicted.
Broxton has won the first three events, followed by Tidewater Tech and State... and lastly, little Godolphin College... which has not scored a single point... nor, in my humble opinion, seems likely to.
The discus throw.
LJ Sewell of Broxton College, the first contestant.
Ladies and gentlemen, it looks like a new meet record!
In the discus throw, Sewell of Broxton College... 210 feet and 11 inches.
Now, you're gonna do fine, Bagwell.
Just remember to let go on the second turn, huh?
Let go, second turn.
Right, Coach.
Okay.
Bagwell of Godolphin College ready on the discus throw.
Oh, how I dread this.
Let go!
Bagwell, let go of the discus!
Bagwell of Godolphin College fouls.
You know, Dean, this whole thing bugs me.
You take the profits made by my football boys, then go right out and blow it... on sweat socks and stuff for this crummy team.
Excuse me.
Would you be good enough to spare me your usual soliloquy on sweat socks?
Mr Seymour, may I speak with you for a moment, please?
Why, certainly, Professor, anytime.
Run along, fellas.
Now, Professor, what can I do for you?
Well, yesterday, uh...
I shan't explain how, but... $900 belonging to the Daughters of the Buccaneers... was bet on Godolphin.
Say, now.
So the bet was all your doing, huh?
Well, I...
I was wondering... if you would be kind enough to cancel the bet and give us back the money?
Professor, as you know, I'm a man of principle.
And man and boy, my guiding principle has always been a bet's a bet.
But look at those poor old ladies.
What's gonna happen to them?
You know they have nowhere to go.
I've been thinking about those dear old girls... living in that drafty inn, working their fingers to the bone... living from hand to mouth... cluttering up that valuable piece of real estate.
Now, do they know about this?
Of course not.
I wouldn't dare raise false hopes.
Then you won't give it back?
Sweetness, what do you take me for?
Oh, Professor, you'd better hold onto this.
That may become very valuable someday.
I know your sort.
Ready for the start of the mile run.
Contestants will take their positions.
My great, great granddaughters.
By thunder!
There be a time for action!
Old ladies, Blackbeard's coming.
Up the Jolly Roger!
Well, let's see where we stand now.
The mile run is in its second lap.
Leading at the moment is Broxton.
Over at the high jump, Shockley of Godolphin.
What was that?
Unusual jumping style there.
Hey, Coach, Shockley just cleared 6' 11 "!
Our Shockley?
And they're trying for seven feet!
Shockley of Godolphin jumping.
He clears the bar at seven feet.
Great stuff, Coach.
Where did you find him?
Well, we never know, do we?
It only proves that nothing is certain in the world of... Just a moment.
Here's the final lap of the mile run coming around now.
Where did you find him, Coach?
Get out of there!
Excuse me.
You idiot!
Get off the track!
What's going on over here?
Hey, fella, come back here!
I don't need these, of course, but just for a moment there... it looked as though they were running backward.
Come on back!
They are.
Keep going!
Keep going!
Come join the mollies dance, lad!
'Twill raise your reedy spirits.
I'm telling you to get off this field... right now!
If you ask me, he makes a better pom-pom girl than he does a coach.
It's Chulay of Godolphin, ready with thejavelin throw.
Stop!
Stop!
Where do you think you're going, Coach?
270 feet, 4 inches for Chulay of Godolphin.
The shot put event.
Wilkins of Broxton College, the first contestant.
What do you mean, you want to enter a protest?
Didn't you win those last three events?
That's just the point.
It wasn't us, it was... Look.
Now, look.
Look.
He's at it again.
Okay, I'm looking.
Wilkins, a little off form tonight.
That comes to 5 feet, 11 inches.
Now, did you see that?
Okay, he flubbed one.
What's the big problem?
And now, Gudger Larkin of Godolphin is ready with his effort.
It's really not much of a...
It seems to be coming this way.
Impossible.
72 feet, 3 inches... a new shot put record for Larkin.
Excuse me, but I have to see some sweet old ladies about a bet.
Godolphin to win?
Have you gone out of your mind?
Not yet, but the evening's still young.
Mr Seymour!
Why don't you stop your babbling and get out of here?
Well, if you'd just listen to what I have to say.
We're under pressure too!
The pole vault bar is set at 17 feet, 5 inches.
First contestant, Carson of Broxton College.
I knew he'd go too far!
Nail him!
Mr. Walker, one more disturbance, you'll be ruled off the field entirely.
Now, is that clear?
Second contestant on the pole vault.
Neilson of Godolphin College... sets a new record of 17 feet, 5 inches in the pole vault.
Go, Godolphin, go!
I never saw you get this excited at a football game.
Yea, Godolphin!
May I tell you something, Mr Purvis?
Yea, Godolphin!
Go!
I hate football.
Yea, Godolphin!
I've always hated football!
Go, go, go!
Well, lad, what do you think of your old matey now, eh?
They could hang me for what I think of you know!
Didn't I tell you... to keep your hands off of my boys?
Oh, you do, do you?
Well, let me simply say you are the lowest, most underhanded... miserable excuse for what used to be a human being that's ever been my misfortune... to be in any shape, way or form connected with!
I thought I was helping you.
Helping?
Well, that's a yuck for ya!
Didn't you say yourself that if I helped them old ladies... that that would contribute towards me own salvation?
You haven't helped them.
You haven't helped anybody.
Haven't helped anybody?
I perceive now how difficult it is... to do a good deed in this dirty world.
Just go away.
Just go away.
Just get out of my life.
No, no, no.
You mean nothing but trouble.
You mean...
I can see now... why the very mention of your name used to give everybody the creeps.
Well, I'm gonna find a comfortable place.
I'm gonna rest there, somewhere.
And I'm gonna stay out of your affairs.
Great, great.
That's the best news I've had in years.
Go disappear yourself.
I'm gonna disappear myself, that's what I'm gonna do.
Mr Sanctimonious Scupperlout!
Sink me if I raise so much as a finger to help you in the future.
I'd rather spend a winter of eternities in limbo... than knock knees a tick longer... with a nit like you.
There, I've said it.
The final event of the evening, the relay races, are about to begin.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I had to do that.
You see what he's trying to do, don't you?
Hmm?
Well, the rotten pirate wants to make me as-as crooked as he is.
Well, I don't buy it.
I'm standing on my principles.
Why, sure, Coach.
Where'd any of us be without our principles?
You betcha.
You betcha.
Tiny Godolphin College, perennial underdog for two decades... has come back with the biggest bang you've ever seen.
Coach Walker of Godolphin, the man of the hour.
Throwing in an attack of dazzling new techniques... his inspired team of star performers... has slashed its way up into a tie with Broxton.
Now victory hangs in the balance as we come to the final event of the evening.
The question... What is going to happen as Godolphin faces... Broxton's mighty relay team?
Gentlemen, take your marks.
Set.
Come on, Broxton!
Run, you punk!
Go, Godolphin!
Come on, team!
Come on, team!
Yea!
At we come to the end of the first lap in this crucial race... the first three runners are closely bunched.
Now they pass the baton for the start of the second lap.
It's Broxton first, Tidewater second, State third...
Yes, and there's the Godolphin man, labouring along in the rear.
Easy now, Coach.
You're tensing up again.
Maybe I shouldn't have yelled at him that way.
I mean, how's a poor, dumb pirate supposed to know what principles are, huh?
But I do.
I've gotta shave this face every morning.
I know, Coach.
I shave too.
You bet you do.
You gotta look at yourself.
You've gotta live with yourself.
I gotta go with my principles.
Sure, Coach.
You do that.
I will, I will.
Well, folks, it's just about all over but the shouting.
Middle of the second lap, Broxton is already half a lap ahead of Godolphin.
Do we win something for fourth place?
I'm afraid not.
You see those little old ladies up there?
Well, I'm gonna let those little old ladies get tossed right out on their ear.
How's that for a principle?
Well... Beginning the third lap, Broxton is in first place... followed in order by Tidewater, State and Godolphin.
Who says you can't win 'em all?
Come on.
Let's get out of this folk festival.
Look at Silky and his boys.
All they wanna do is squeeze every loose nickel out of this county.
Well, just because I have a chance to cut their water off doesn't mean...
I have to get mixed up in it, does it?
Well, don't just sit there now, you coldhearted creep!
Yes, you!
Get up!
Do something!
Oh, don't give me that!
I know you can hear me!
What are you going to do about them?
Your own kith and kin!
So, Bob, you gonna let 'em get pushed around because of my principles?
Don't you have any pride?
Come on!
You started it.
Finish it.
Come on!
Move it!
Someday I'm gonna strangle him.
Come on!
Hurry!
Pour it on!
Hurry up!
Come on!
Come on!
Let's go!
As we approach the last lap, Dewey of Broxton is well in the lead.
He passes the baton to... No, he didn't.
He still has it.
The Broxton anchor man is running the last lap... with a hot dog?
Tidewater makes their pass.
State makes their pass, and...
I believe, yes... the State anchor man seems to have a bottle of...
The Godolphin man, who was half a lap behind, approaches the passing zone.
Come on, Godolphin!
Come on!
Ahoy, there!
A perfect change!
Friends, Gudger Larkin of Godolphin... is the only one of the four anchor men to have completed a clean pass.
Now he streaks past the other contestants... who are on their way back to retrieve their batons!
We seem to have a slight hang-up in the passing zone.
Dewey of State has got a hold of Broxton's baton.
Let's check that.
No, it's the hot dog.
Carver of Broxton... a real head's-up performer, has got a hold of two batons.
No!
One is snatched away by Wilson of Tidewater!
Come on, Broxton, stop foolin' around!
Gudger Larkin has taken advantage of the rhubarb... and has forged almost a third of a lap ahead of the field.
Catch 'em!
Catch 'em!
Come on!
Gudger Larkin of Godolphin is still in front... but he's beginning to run out of gas and the others are hot on his heels!
Stop him!
Stop him!
Not that, you meathead!
Go, Godolphin, go!
Get up.
Get up!
Get up, Gudger!
Get up!
A one-of-a-kind relay team.
Get away from me, you old bats!
We-We won!
We won all 45,000 lovely smackeroos!
We won!
Technically, maybe we won, but actually... You did it, boy!
You did it!
Brilliant work!
Sir, I think when you hear what I have to say... Say?
What is there to say?
The scoreboard says it all!
We thank you, we thank you, we thank you, we thank you!
No rough stuff, old ladies.
You be nice to him.
Miss Stowecroft?
Oh, Professor, we're so happy.
Mr Ainsworth from the bank is coming over, and you can give him the money.
And at the stroke of midnight, we'd like Mr Walker to have the honour of burning the mortgage.
He's done so much for us.
Well, where is Mr Walker, who's done so much for us?
Well, I believe he's up in his room.
Is anything wrong?
Excuse me.
But why go now?
I mean, the lads have triumphed.
The wager's won.
Your wench is happy.
There's enough money set aside for the old ladies.
I fail to divine your reason for leaving.
Well, don't strain your brain.
Furthermore, when the mortgage... is consigned to the flames tonight, there is a very good chance... the horrible curse may be lifted off my good self... in which case you may be able to settle down to a serene... albeit somewhat dull... life without me.
Look, frizzface, you think I can stay around here... after what happened out there tonight?
What am I supposed to do for an encore?
No, I'm bailing out.
I've got to go somewhere...
I can make a fresh start... honestly, this time.
Very well.
It be no concern of mine.
I just think it may be a little early for you to be striking your colours!
Stri... Come in!
Oh.
Hi.
Where are you going?
I'm leaving.
After taking my money and-and stirring everything up... you're running off and leaving us in a lurch?
No, you don't!
What are you squawking about?
You got it back, didn't you?
No, I didn't.
Silky welshed on the bet.
He what?
Well, he...
He just laughed and said he wasn't gonna pay off.
He's throwing Miss Stowecroft and the others out first thing in the morning.
Under normal conditions, if I can remember such a time...
I have a sweet and a loveable nature.
Well, you-you know what I think?
If I may proffer a suggestion...
Shut up!
Both of you!
Both of who?
I am sick and tired... of people thinking and suggesting and giving me a lot of cheap advice.
What I am gonna do, I am gonna find that happy hoodlum... and I am gonna wring that money out of his crooked little neck!
Steve-Steve, you can't, not in your condition.
What condition?
Well, anyone can see you're hallucinating again.
Steve, you can't fight Silky and his men.
She's right, son.
This be a job what takes innards.
Innards?
Oh, well, you just sit here and contemplate yours.
I've got a job to do.
Permission to come with you, sir?
Oh, no, buddy boy.
No more of your big ideas.
I'm calling the shots this time.
Proud to serve under you, sir.
You mean that?
My word, sir, is the ultimate warranty.
All right, shipmate, let's go!
Make ready the boarding party, Captain.
Thank ye, Admiral.
Cutlass.
You might need that.
Uh-huh.
What?
Oh, it's on the bed.
Oh, Steve.
You really have flipped.
Beat, two quarters, drummer boy.

Sing out.
Don't mumble!

We'd like to see Mr Seymour.
Look, sister, I'm telling you once and for all... Mr Seymour don't wanna see... Come on.
I'll be with you in a minute.
Now, what can I do for you?
We're here to collect the money you owe Professor Baker.
The money I owe her?
You gotta be kidding.
Mr Seymour, you're gonna pay every cent of that money, or I... Or what, Mr Walker?
Or we might have to get tough.
Now, do I get some action, or don't I?
Mr Walker, I have got to admire your style.
I really do.
I'll tell you what.
You know, there's no use beating up a guy who's the town hero tonight.
It's bad for my image.
You know what I mean?
Professor... here's the $900 you put down on the bet.
Go ahead, take it.
Oh, no!
You know very well we need the full amount you rightfully owe us.
Professor, let me level with you.
If I pay you back all that loot, then you'll give it to the old ladies... who'll pay back the bank, right?
And bingo, there goes my childhood dream... namely, running one of those class gambling joints... like they have out west.
I'm sorry, no dice.
But I'll tell you what.
We have a very nice roulette wheel here.
Why don't you forget this phony bet?
Take the $900.
Go out there and win some money honestly.
I'll guarantee you, sweetie, you'll sleep a lot better tonight.
Mr Seymour, come up with the full amount, or I'm gonna take this place apart.
Yeah?
You have exactly 15 seconds... What?
I said, take the money, lad.
Let the wench try her luck.
Let her what?
Suppose she loses?
You sure it'll work?
Okay.
We'll take it.
What?
We most certainly will not take it!
Mr Seymour has made a very meritorious suggestion.
You know, Mr Walker, I do not understand you.
One minute, you are a-a-a knight in shining armour.
And the next minute, you are a... Well, we all make mistakes, right, Mr Seymour?
Mr Walker, it's a smart man who knows when to crawfish.
Come along.
I'll show you to a nice, quiet room... reserved for our more valued-type customers.
But I don't know how to gamble.
This is a good place to learn.
Harry, these are friends of mine.
Take good care of them, will ya?
Okay, Mr Seymour.
Good luck, folks.
Uh, $900 worth, please.
Yes, sir.
Now, don't worry about a thing.
Just let me handle this.
I'll take the chips, please.
Yellows are a dollar... the reds are five... the blues are 25, the whites 100.
Don't you have any 50-cent chips?
Not in this room, lady.
Make your bets, please.
It's 28 minutes to midnight.
Now hurry up.
Oh!
Oh, 29 is a good number.
No, no, no, no.
Bet 'em all.
We don't have time to fool around.
Mr Walker, are you trying to lose my $900 from me again?
No more bets, please.
The number is 31.
Oh, that's not my numb... Oh, how nice.
Make your bets, please.
Ride, ride.
Let it ride.
Let the whole thing ride.
Oh.
No, no.
You can't win that way.
Put it on one number.
Would you please just let me do it my way?
No more bets, please.
Number 32.
And we ha... And we have $36 on number 32?
I won!
I won!
I told you I had a talent for this.
Okay, okay.
Pay me!
Pay me!
35 times 36... Evening, folks.
What goes on here?
You tell me.
We're doing fine.
We're doing just great.
Now let's see.
Let's put 'em all on... No, no.
Don't tell me!
Let me do it!
No, let me try one!
Steve, have you ever played this game before?
No, but I can tell ya... Then leave my chips alone, because I have a system.
A system?
What system?
Woman's intuition.
That's what.
Will you put 'em all on one number.
No!
Steve!
All right?
Don't you understand?
Time's running out.
Spin the wheel, please.
Watch the board.
Whatever happens, watch those chips on the board.
One more like that and we're home.
35 times 36... Well, now we let it ride.
Don't fool with it any more.
Go to the gaff.
Gotcha.
Would you spin the wheel, please?
Yes, ma'am.
Everything rides on number 20.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh, we did it!
We did it!
What?
Number 15.
So very sorry, ma'am.
You know what I think?
I think this is a stupid game.
I don't understand.
Something must have gone wrong.
I'll say something went wrong.
We lost almost everything.
All right.
Don't panic.
Relax, relax.
We've still got half of the chips we won the first time.
Scurvy cheat.
Look, put 'em all down.
Put all the chips down.
If we put all the chips we've got left onto one number... and it comes up... Yeah.
We're still in business.
Make your bets, please.
The only question is...
The only question is, what if it doesn't come up?
Don't worry.
Everything is go, all on 11.
Steve, that's all we have!
No more bets, please.
Everything goes on 11.
Relax.
We did it!
We did it!
We won!
We won!
Yeah, we did great.
Now, come on.
We got enough.
Enough?
Enough?
What?
Are you out of your mind?
We're on a winning streak!
Think of those dear old ladies!
Think of what we could buy them.
We could buy them warm coats and cars and polo ponies.
Are you kidding?
We gotta get out of here.
We barely have time to make it.
Hey, pay up, will you?
Wait.
Let me place one-one more.
Pay up.
We're in a very big hurry.
A small bet.
$ 100?
Maybe 20... 25?
Hey, fella.
Hey.
A dollar.
A dollar.
Pay up, yes.
36,000.
36,000.
37,000.
37,000.
38,000.
38,000.
That's enough.
We thank you, the Daughters of the Buccaneers thank you, and good night.
Enough?
Let's go.
There's still more.
Maybe we should take it for good luck.
Not yet.
I just put down a new carpet.
I hear you've done very well.
Not bad.
May I see?
Please.
My, my.
That's very nice, indeed.
I'm very happy for you.
See?
You made out all right.
You took Silky's advice, right?
Now, why don't you take Silky's advice again and let me keep this for you?
No, you don't.
You know, this is an awful lot of bread... for you to be carrying around here, honey.
This is a very dangerous neighbourhood.
Okay, Professor, give me the bag.
I've been very patient with both of you and very civilized.
Okay, boys.
Go on over there, Jo Anne.
Go on.
Make with the muscle.
All right, boys, make your play.
Missed me.
What's the matter with you?
Get up and get him!
And now for Mr Seymour.
Steve!
Get his guns!
Get-Get the gun!
Steve!
Shoot him!
Shoot him!
I shot him.
Don't point that thing over here!
All ashore what's going ashore!
Come on!
Steve!
Oh, quite nice, lad, yes.
There's a boat down here.
Come on.
Proceed, lad.
I'll just tidy up bit.
Have fun.
Help!
Help!
Come on.
Stop fooling around!
Get him any way you can!
Got any idea who we're fighting?
It ain't "who' I'm worried about, it's "what".
Are we winning, Mr Seymour?
Who-Who's that?
It's me, stupid.
It's around here someplace.
Yeah, well if you think that thing scares me... Stop 'em!
Stop... Can't you give us just a little more time?
I'm very sorry, ladies, but I'm always precise in these matters.
According to the terms of this document... unless you produce the required payment at midnight of this date... which is just 11 seconds from now...
Eight, seven... six...
Thank you, Mr Ainsworth.
It's a pleasure to do business with you.
Mr Walker, this is the moment that most of us... have been waiting for all our lives.
Will you burn the mortgage?
Miss Stowecroft, thank you very much, but that honour's not for me.
L...
Knock their heads together Here comes the fella you really should thank.
A green-eyed maiden too And a green-eyed maiden too Knock them in the head and drop them in the river With a green-eyed maiden and a... Oh, no, she said Oh, yes, I said Oh, no, you don't again She said Hello, old buddy.
I'm glad to see you.
Ladies, all of you repeat after me, please.
You too.
Allow me to present your real benefactor.
Captain Blackbeard!
My respects, ma'am.
Good ladies, your welcome has touched me deeply.
Loathe as I am to play the gallant...
I am bound to say... that I've never beheld a concourse of fair creatures... which has stirred me more.
Oh, yes.
Thank ye for your esteem.
Thank ye.
And yet you cannot know what it has been like for a person of my disposition... to have been still of tongue, to have had no one to talk to... for 200 accursed and dusty years.
Yet now, my voice is heard once again.
Oh, I do thank you.
Yet stay.
It is not my wish... as a person... as generous as my good self... to seek to take the lion's share of the glory.
No, no.
Oh, no.
This young... rooster, my good friend... he played a modest part... in your delivery from disaster.
Well, I'd only... Not now, son.
Our heart is too full to hear more.
Now, if I might have that vile document.
Aldetha... the time is here.
I go now... to a distant... and I hope, hospitable shore.
I beg of you... take notice of this.
I, Edward Teach, captain... affectionately known... as Blackbeard... was not all bad.
Look after this boy.
He needs help.
Fare thee well, lad.
Good-bye, Captain.
We will not meet again.
Beware all wenches.
For he's a jolly good fellow He's a jolly good fellow And so say all of us Share this one amongst you, me beauties.
You know something?
I think I'm gonna miss the old scoundrel.
You know something?
I loved you even when I thought you were nuts.
Look!
Captain, proud to see you again, sir.
Where have you been?
You're a sight for sore eyes, you are, sir.
Where are we off to now?
Now, you lazy swabs, stir yourselves!
Lift anchor.
Shake out the main.
Lively now, or I'll carve your gizzard... and fry it for me supper!
Dr.
Blood!
Who is it?
That we'll know better when you've opened the door.
Me?
My mistake.
After I've opened the door.
Open it, quick!
Why, Jeremy Pitt, isn't it?
It's your friend, Lord Gildoy, wounded at Andrew Baynes' farm by the river.
-The rash fool.
-He sent me for you.
No time to lose.
Why, to be sure, I'll lose none, nor my head either.
Come in and regain yours while I get my things.
-I'll wait here.
-As you please.
Come, Mrs. Barlow, help me dress.
Jeremy, how was the battle?
Battle?
Slaughter, rather!
What can clubs do against cannon?
In case this business keeps me overlong, take care you water my geraniums... especially those under the bedroom window.
Geraniums.
Won't you ever grow up?
One would think you were still at medical school.
Geraniums!
You would think of geraniums... when every other able-bodied man is out fighting.
It's out of favor I seem to be with you, my vinegary virgin.
-Half the town is saying you're a papist.
-Why?
Because I have the sense to sleep tonight instead of rushing to my ruin... in an attempt to put this Duke of Monmouth on the throne?
He'd be even worse than King James.
Make haste with that cloak there, my pretty one.
And the other half of the town that defends you... claims that you're just a coward.
Mrs. Barlow, my darling, you can tell them, if you like... that I've been most anywhere that fighting was in evidence.
Fought for the French against the Spanish, and the Spanish against the French... and I learned my seamanship in the Dutch Navy.
But having had adventure enough in six years to last me six lives...
I came here, hung up the sword, and picked up the lancet.
Became a man of peace and not of war.
A healer, not a slayer... and that I am going to be as long as I'm on top of the sod and not under it.
-Will you be back for breakfast?
-Who knows, my pretty one?
The worst is done, my friend.
Give your mind peace.
The King's men!
There's nothing to fear.
This is a Christian country.
Christian men don't make war on the wounded... or those who shelter them.
I'm Capt.
Hobart of Col. Kirke's dragoons.
What rebels do you harbor?
No rebels.
This wounded gentleman-- No need to ask how he came by his wounds.
A rebel.
Out with him.
This man can't be moved without peril to his life.
Who the devil may you be?
Peter Blood, Medicinae Baccalaureus.
Don't fling your French at me.
Latin, my dull friend.
lt means I'm a doctor.
Or a liar.
lf your wit were as big as your voice, it's the great man you'd be for this.
You may find me great enough to hang you!
Yes, I don't doubt it.
You've the looks and manners of a hangman.
Take him away, and the others, too!
''ln the name of His Majesty, Our Sovereign Lord... ''prisoners of the Crown, you stand indicted... ''for having maliciously and traitorously conspired... ''to change, alter, and wholly to subvert the ancient government... ''of this Kingdom of England.
''Therefore, you are charged with high treason... ''against the most illustrious and most excellent... ''Prince James II by the grace of God... ''of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland, King.
''Having no fear of God in your hearts... ''and being moved and seduced by the devil... ''you have failed in the love of due obedience toward the King... ''and have moved to disturb the tranquility of the nation... ''and to stir up war to depose said king from title... ''honor, and the regal name of the imperial crown.
''Therefore, you are here to be tried before His Majesty's Commissioner... ''the Lord Chief Justice, Baron Jeffreys of Wem... ''and by a jury of 12 good men and true.''
James Haynsworth, hold up your hand.
-Guilty or not guilty?
-Guilty.
-Harold Carron, guilty or not guilty?
-Guilty.
-Andrew Baynes, guilty or not guilty?
-Guilty.
-Jeremy Pitt, guilty or not guilty?
-Guilty.
-John Wolverstone, guilty or not guilty?
-Guilty.
Uriah Ogle, guilty or not guilty?
Guilty.
Praise the Lord.
Henry Hagthorpe, guilty or not guilty?
Guilty.
-Lord Chester Dyke, guilty or not guilty?
-Guilty.
Peter Blood, guilty or not guilty?
lt's entirely innocent, I am.
Take the stand and face His Lordship.
Are you guilty or not guilty?
You must use the right words.
Words, is it?
Not guilty.
And speaking of words, I'd like to say a few about the injustice... of keeping an innocent man locked up for three months... in such filth and heat and ill-feeding that my chief regret is I didn't try... to pull down the filthy fellow that sits on the throne.
Silence!
Are you entirely ignorant of the proper procedure of the court?
Most happily ignorant up to now.
I could gladly have done without this acquaintance.
Enough of this.
There is nothing more to be said, except the passing of sentence.
May it please Your Lordship, but there's a deal more to be said!
Silence!
-How now, fellow?
-There is the little matter of my defense.
Very well, then... but in heaven's name, be brief, man.
We have much to do.
I am guilty of nothing, my lord... unless it be adjudged a crime that a man try to live peaceably.
Living peaceably with the army of Monmouth?
I was not with Monmouth's army, my lord.
I was arrested while engaging in my profession as physician.
What's this?
You tell us you're a doctor, you rogue?
And as such was summoned to the aid of Lord Gildoy... by Jeremy Pitt, who can so testify.
Master Pitt will testify.
He that is himself a confessed traitor.
-ls that your witness?
-There is also Andrew Baynes.
Master Baynes will have enough testifying... in a useless effort to keep his own neck from the halter.
I can bring a hundred from Bridgwater, the town where I live.
We've no time for all this.
lf these other traitors are as stubborn as you...
I may sit here till the next assizes.
Very well, then.
There's a witness I'll give you that you can't deny: yourself, sir.
For if I'm not physician, how is it I know that you're a dying man?
The death to which you're dooming hundreds of poor men daily... in a frantic effort to send their souls to perdition before your own... is a light pleasantry... compared to the bleeding death in the lungs... to which the great Judge has condemned you.
Now, fellow, we'll be done with the witnesses... and I will convict you out of your own rascally mouth.
When this Pitt came to summon you, as you claim... did you know you were called to attend another rebel?
My business was with his wounds, not his politics.
Did you know the law... that any person who does knowingly receive, harbor, comfort... or succor a rebel is as guilty as if he himself bore arms?
I only knew my sacred duty as a physician.
Your sacred duty, rogue, is to your king!
I thought it was to my fellow man.
lt's a fearful thing to send a man's soul to perdition... but I am bound by my conscience... and my love of my king to deal out justice.
Therefore, I instruct you, gentlemen of the jury... that inasmuch as Peter Blood has admitted... aiding a traitor to your king... you do bring in a verdict of guilty... that he may be hanged... for the high treason he has committed.
What a creature must sit on the throne... who lets a man like you deal out his justice.
-Your Majesty.
-Sunderland, what brings you here?
These numerous hangings.
Splendid, aren't they?
We kill the rebels, we kill the rebellion.
Very true, Your Majesty... but a foolish waste of valuable human flesh.
How so?
Your Majesty's colonies in the West Indies are urgently in need of slaves.
A healthy, vigorous man can be reckoned worth from 10 to 20.
Splendid, Sunderland.
Send out word immediately that the King is graciously pleased to command... that all rebels convicted but not yet hanged... be gathered together... and shipped by the first available boats to the Americas.
Give us water!
There are men dying down here.
You'd think they'd take better care of a valuable cargo like us.
Ahoy, the deck!
Land sighted, Port Royal!
lt's a truly royal clemency we're granted, my friends... one well worthy of King James.
He spares us the mercifully quick extinction of the hangman's rope... and gives the slow death of slavery.
He grants us our lives in exchange for a living death.
lt's an uncertain world entirely.
''Be it known, men, that these prisoners who stand before you... ''are now to be sold at a right and fitting price.
''They may be put to labor in the sulfur mines... ''or on the plantations for a period of 10 years.
''And the parties to whom they are assigned... ''must enter into security for the proper punishment... ''of their offense.''
His Excellency, the Governor of Port Royal.
Guards, attention!
Present muskets.
Good day, Captain.
Lovely day, isn't it?
Or is it?
-Good day, Dixon.
-Good day, Governor.
I suppose we can begin this sale now, Governor.
No, better wait for Col. Bishop.
He has the privilege of being late for everything.
Yes, I know.
There he is.
-Good afternoon, Col. Bishop.
-Good afternoon, Governor.
Good afternoon, Miss Arabella.
How is my darling, the Governor, and his foot?
Every day I think my gout can't get any worse... and every day it does.
My dear Colonel, according to the King's request... it is for you to take first choice of this dainty nosegay... and at your own price.
Egad, they're an appalling lot... not likely to be of much value on the plantation.
The less you want, the more for Dixon.
-Dixon?
Uncle, I wish you'd buy them all.
-Buy them all?
To keep them out of Dixon's hands.
I perceive somebody's been talking behind my back... telling the truth.
-And you can joke.
-Arabella dear, don't be childish.
These men are rebels against their king.
They should be hanged, drawn, and quartered.
-Any fate they meet is too good for them.
-Your uncle is right.
-Let the sale commence.
-My foot!
My dear, the law is the law, and it's His Majesty's law... and must be obeyed.
The best of the lot.
Open your mouth.
-20.
-Sold!
Sold to Col. Bishop for 20.
-As if he were buying horses.
-Yes, quite.
-Same price.
-This is Jeremy Pitt, ship's pilot... young and sturdy.
-Same price.
-Sold!
Sold to Col. Bishop for 20.
Quiet!
Open your mouth.
His pride has bought him a ticket to Dixon's mines.
He isn't there yet.
-My dear, consider your social position!
-Uncle!
-Which one?
-That one.
-Him?
I will not.
-But I want you to.
No.
Let him cool his head in Dixon's mines.
I'll have none of him.
-5.
-5?
That's an insulting sum to offer.
-Does anyone offer more?
-6.
7.
You're making an exhibition of yourself... a girl like you, bidding for a slave before these people.
-Will you buy him?
-Certainly not.
8.
When a lady's interested in a man....
Calm down, Dixon, 8 is nothing for such a man... a skilled physician, a gentleman, and a scholar.
-All right, 9.
-10!
lt's apparent Miss Bishop wants him more than I do.
Sold to Miss Arabella Bishop for 10.
Sold!
10, sold.
What would you like done with him, Miss Bishop?
Why, I don't know.
You're extremely foolish.
lt might have cost you your life.
lt was fortunate for you that I was here to save you.
I hardly consider it fortunate to be bought by anyone by the name of Bishop.
You could learn a lesson in gratitude.
I could thank for not interfering.
As it happens, you are hardly in a position to have anything to say about it.
You may join the others belonging to my uncle... and henceforth you may take your orders from him.
Your very humble slave, Miss Bishop.
Come on.
Move on, there.
Last night, this dog attempted to escape.
Today you'll see what happens to those who forget... that my friend King James did you all a favor... in saving you from your just fate on the gallows.
Show them the iron, Kent.
F-T. Whoever wears that brand is known as a fugitive traitor... and will be treated as such.
Burn those letters in your brain... lest they be burned on your hides, too.
There speaks a fit friend for King James if ever I heard one.
Would I had him and his friend James roasting on a spit over that fire.
Great would be the burning thereof and loud the rejoicing in Heaven.
Do your duty!
What a cruel shame that any man is made to suffer so.
-This beastly gout!
-Perhaps a new dressing will help.
Perhaps.
-I have it here.
-Put it down.
So sorry, Doctor.
Easy, you clumsy louts!
-We won't hurt you, Governor.
-You thick-fingered jackasses!
His Excellency will have his little joke.
lll-begotten bunglers!
-Blundering pill peddlers!
-Your Excellency-- That is the final straw.
Out of this house... and never let me see your faces again.
-But think of our reputations.
-Hang your reputations!
Leave me!
I don't want to see you again!
Away!
Out!
I don't want to see you!
Out into the streets!
Stop shouting.
You brought on my headache again.
Good!
Hannibal, come take my crutch.
Easy, now.
Help me up with my foot.
No remedy.
Why, thank you, dear.
Why doesn't His Excellency try another doctor?
Another doctor?
There are only those two on this wretched island... -and each one is worse than his partner.
-There is another.
And according to what I've heard, he became a slave by being a doctor.
A slave?
Would you elevate a slave to the position of doctor to the Governor?
-ls he a good doctor?
-I don't know.
Why are you laughing?
I'm just thinking how annoyed Peter Blood would be... if I did him another favor.
Your Excellency, there are diverse citizens of this sovereign island... who come before you with complaints.
Complaints, complaints.
Can none of my citizens follow the example of their governor... who endures the utmost agony without a murmur?
-Easy there, fellow.
-Did I hurt you, sir?
No, but I thought you were going to.
Your Excellency, this vagrant hides his sins... behind the name of Honesty Nuttall.
-He's charged with being in debt.
-State your case, fellow, and no lies.
I was on the way to pay the butcher on Tuesday... as Honesty Nuttall is my name, when I chanced on a poor old beggar.
lt was Jones from the grog shop... who begged me to have a drink with him.
Try standing on it, Your Honor.
Stand on that bundle of pain?
Impossible.
I remembered in time my poor starving wife in need of the five bob.
What is this all about?
Silence!
-Sit down.
-What's he here for?
For debt, Your Excellency, and the prevaricator-- lf it's for debt, don't annoy me with such petty things.
Order him to work it off.
Work?
Not that, anything but work.
What's your trade?
I'm a ship's carpenter when the painful necessity arises.
Take him to work on the docks... and don't you attempt to escape till every farthing's paid... or I'll stretch your hide on the rack!
Escape?
How could a debtor escape from this island... even if he had a boat to do it with?
I couldn't escape any more than a slave could escape.
I can walk.
Wonderful, my dear fellow.
Only two months' treatment, and I'm a well man.
lt's a miracle.
-The next complaint-- -Drat the next complaint.
I can walk.
Come, Doctor.
You'll get your reward for this, Peter Blood.
-From now on, you're my physician.
-Your Excellency is too kind.
Come back early tomorrow.
You're always welcome, Dr.
Blood.
Hello.
Don't I know you?
A lady should know her own property.
-My property?
-Let me refresh your memory.
My name is Peter Blood, and I'm worth precisely 10.
Forgive me for not recognizing you, Dr.
Blood.
You're so changed... for the better.
The Governor tells me I have you to thank for that.
You don't sound very grateful, Dr.
Blood.
Do you think I'd be grateful for an easy life when my friends are treated like animals?
lt's they deserve your favors, not I.
They're all honest rebels.
I was snoring in my bed while they were trying to free England... from an unclean tyrant.
I believe you're talking treason.
I hope I'm not obscure.
-You could be flogged for that.
-No.
The Governor would never allow it.
He has the gout.
You depend upon that?
I intend to, for all it's worth, and that promises to be considerable.
But you'd hardly know about that.
You've probably never had the gout.
-Good afternoon, Miss Bishop.
-Good afternoon.
15-2, 15-4, and a pair are six.
-Another?
-What else is there to do... ever since you ruined the Governor's foot and our reputations with it?
-I ruined the Governor's foot?
-I tell you, Doctor, you're methods are-- -Someone coming.
-A patient?
A patient!
-I beg your pardon, Doctor.
I'm so sorry.
-lt's all right.
Come in.
Good afternoon, colleagues.
Dr. Bronson.
-Dr. Whacker.
-Good afternoon.
How's business, my friends?
-Terrible.
-Good.
-Terribly good.
-That relieves me.
I had heard that things were not altogether.... ldle gossip, obviously.
You intend to remain here?
Remain here?
Why not?
lt's queer.
There are you, free to come and go as you please, and you choose to stay here.
While I, who hate this pestilential island....
Such are the quirks of circumstance.
I must be running along, gentlemen.
Good day, gentlemen.
lt's pleasant to see everything so prosperous with you here.
-Not so hasty.
-Just a moment.
There's something I'd like to ask you.
Well, gentlemen?
Have you been thinking of leaving us, Doctor?
Leaving?
Now, Doctor.
How could a slave think of leaving?
Or even if he were fool enough to try, by what means could he hope to escape?
And where, for example, could he raise the few pounds necessary... to purchase even a small boat?
-We might supply it.
-You?
-Now, gentlemen.
-Now, let's talk this thing over.
Now, if you'll just sit down here.
Now then, how much will you need?
20 might buy a small wherry, 10 more might equip it.
He's right.
-He means-- -You needn't tell me what he means.
I know two Christian gentlemen when I see them.
Two men whose hearts are bleeding for a brother doctor in distress.
But it's too much to ask, too noble a gesture to hope for.
No, my good man, not at all.
But who would buy the boat?
We would not dare, and you, a slave, you could not.
True.
That would be my part.
To find someone.
A man as eager to escape as I.
-A man held here for debt, say.
-Then it's a bargain?
Gentlemen, you've opened for me the gates of hope.
Doctor.
-My dear colleague.
-Gentlemen.
Now we have him.
We've only to get him involved and reveal his plan.
He'll steal very little of our business when he's in irons.
Gentlemen.
There's one thing slipped my mind entirely.
Simple-minded men might think this an opportunity for trickery... but brilliant men like yourselves will remember in what favor I stand... with the Governor in contrast to some others... and how little their words would weigh against mine.
Heigh-ho for the Governor's foot!
Good day, gentlemen.
-Are you all with me?
-Yes.
Listen.
There's a man named Nuttall who's in trouble with the Governor.
He's looking for a small boat which he'll purchase... on the night chosen for our escape.
-Escape?
-Quiet!
While he gathers stores and equipment, we must be ready on the inside.
We might steal some sugarcane knives and hack through the stockade walls.
Or dig our way under.
Once at sea, if we get there, our troubles will have just begun.
lf any of you want to withdraw, now's the time.
-No.
-Not me.
You'll be a lubber crew, but I'll match your hearts against any other.
We can thank our stars for Jeremy Pitt.
He was a ship's pilot.
Here's one you won't have to teach.
Six years in King James' Navy.
-What?
-That's nothing.
I was a blooming gunner.
-A gunner?
-ln the King's Navy, too.
I was always ashamed of it up to now.
We'll have a crew yet!
Any of you others been keeping such secrets?
Where's Baynes?
-Where is he?
-He tried to escape today.
No!
Caught?
-Branded?
-Yeah.
No!
Why did you do it, Andy?
I told you I'd try to get you out.
I couldn't stand it any longer.
I couldn't stand it.
I was going mad.
What do you think a man is made of?
How much do you think he can stand?
''Watchman, what of the night?''
lsaiah 21 :1 1 .
Don't make the purchase until well on in the evening.
That way there'll be less risk... of anyone wondering where you came by the money.
Lumme, Captain.
lt ain't too late for us to change our minds.
Stow the provisions away on board as soon as it's dark.
Then all you've got to do is sit down here and wait for us.
ls that all?
Wait all alone in the blooming dark... waiting for someone to come along and nab me.
Nuttall, my lad, there's just one other little thing.
Could you find me a good piece of timber about so thick and so long?
Yes, I think so.
Then do so and lash it to your spine.
lt needs stiffening.
Courage.
I'll join you at midnight.
How long does it take to feed this pack of dogs?
lt's a wonder we make a profit at all.
You don't drive them hard enough.
Get them out of here!
I've just been with Nuttall at the boat.
lt's tonight.
-At last!
-For heaven's sake, command yourself.
-Tonight, Hagthorpe.
-Caution above everything.
He who goes slowly, goes safely.
Remember, Jeremy, you're the only navigator among us.
Without you, there's no escape.
Hello, Uncle!
Riding again?
What do you plan to see riding always the same road?
You'd be surprised what interesting things there are to see on this island... if you only keep your eyes open.
Today, for instance, I saw something that you'd give 1,000 ducats to know.
Stores and equipment are all stowed away onboard.
We could use more food, but there's no money left.
I'm not taking any chances by asking our medical friends for more.
I told Nuttall we'd get to the boat by midnight.
Jeremy, we must not fail tonight.
What the devil have you been up to?
Tonight will be a fine night, judging by the sky.
There you are, Pitt.
Keep it covered up and it should heal in a day or so.
Miss Bishop.
You looking for me, sir?
Yes.
You, stop!
What's the matter?
Why are you shaking?
Nothing.
l.... What's going on between you two?
Why, nothing.
The man has a bad leg.
I'll tend to you later.
Where have you been?
I've been at my work, attending to the Governor.
You lie.
Do I?
The Governor's had another attack of gout.
He's been screaming for you like a wounded horse all the afternoon.
Then it appears I was not with the Governor.
Then where have you been?
-Why, I've been at.... -He was with me, Uncle.
What?
Thank you for protecting my reputation, Dr.
Blood, but it was a useless gallantry.
My uncle knows that I spend my time with whomever I please.
You might choose your company with better taste.
His Excellency's waiting for you!
Here, Kent, lend him your horse.
Yes, sir.
Otherwise, the lout will be all night getting there.
Will I be required there long, sir?
You're afraid your work will interfere with your social affairs?
lf I get back late, before midnight, could I get back into the stockade?
Will you stay here talking all night?
Be off with you!
Take him to the stockade!
Go on, get along in there.
lf he talks, we're lost.
Well?
lt seems that you're continually doing me favors.
-I don't know why.
-Neither do I.
Yes, I do.
lt's because you're so very grateful and always thank me so prettily.
Sure now, you don't blame me for resenting you and your favors.
This is interesting.
I've had men tell me they had reasons for admiring me... and some have even laid claims to reasons for loving me... but for a man to store up reasons for resenting me, how refreshing.
You must tell me a few of them.
The first is reason enough.
You bought me.
I've had no lack of experiences in my time, but to be bought and sold was a new one.
I was in no mood to thank my purchaser.
That I can understand.
Go on.
I've resented you because your name is Bishop.
My thoughts have lumped you with your uncle.
How was I to know that a devil could have.... That a devil could have an angel for a niece?
From a resentful man, that is a pretty fair compliment.
Have you any more reasons for resenting me like that one?
lndeed, I have.
And the strongest of all...
I've resented you because you're beautiful, and I'm a slave.
Do you understand that?
I don't know.
Perhaps if you were to explain further, I....
I've already talked too much.
I'll open your mouth!
You'll stay here without food or water until you talk.
-Why did you lie to your uncle?
-Because.... Dr.
Blood, you're a physician and should know.
ls it not considered unhealthy for a slave to be seen at a boat?
-Why should it be?
-Boats put out to sea.
Slaves may not.
You're jumping to conclusions, aren't you?
Am I?
The Governor will be waiting for you.
Yes.
Miss Bishop, it's difficult for an Irishman to apologize.
But I hope you can forgive me for having thought badly of you.
I will, if you tell me how you think of me now.
How I think of you now?
I think of you....
I think of you as the woman who owns me.
Her slave.
But I think the man is lucky who can count you his friend.
I think you know you can.
Your slave is grateful for all marks of favor.
When you forget your slavery and go so far-- Now there, you're mistaken.
However far this slave may go, he won't forget.
lt's a characteristic we Irish have in common with the elephants.
Hello.
Where are you going?
You're so much improved, I was returning to the stockade.
Don't leave me tonight.
I'm a sick man.
I assure you, sir, there's nothing more I can do.
There must be something.
Perhaps you ought to bleed me again.
Very well, then, if you wish it.
But mind, no more softness about this.
I'm gonna have you well by midnight if I have to bleed you to death.
-Who goes there?
-Peter Blood.
-Jeremy, what's happened?
-Water.
Easy, lad.
I didn't tell him.
I didn't.
-Tell him what, Jeremy?
-About our plans.
My back.
Help me.
-Who did this?
-Bishop.
Bishop.
Swine!
I didn't tell him.
I didn't.
-ls our boat still standing in at the bay?
-Yes, Jeremy.
I wondered if I was still out of my mind.
I've been seeing boats sailing in and out... in and out, but ours will never sail.
Not now.
Or if it does, you'll sail without me.
What?
And get lost at sea without our navigator?
-Nonsense, lad.
-We are not going this time.
lt's hopeless for all of us.
We'll manage somehow.
-What are you doing here?
-Doing?
Why, the duties of my office.
I said he was to have no food nor drink till I ordered.
Sure now, I never heard you.
How could you?
You weren't here.
Then how do you expect me to know what orders you've given?
ln the name of humanity!
lf you know the word.
-You dare take that tone with me?
-Yes, I do!
I've been too soft with you... but that shall be mended.
Kent, tie him up!
Had it easy here up to now.
Get up there.
Now I'll take this rod to you... until there's not an inch of hide left on your dirty carcass.
Another beating?
This will be a good half-dozen of them you've given me in promise.
This will be as real as it is overdue.
And what becomes of His Excellency the Governor's gouty foot?
You'll not save yourself with that device this time.
Nothing will save you.
Pirates!
Spanish pirates!
This is what I call a timely interruption.
Though what will come of it, the devil himself only knows.
We've got to get through the town to get to the boat.
Wait here, lads.
lt's me.
Mr. Nuttall.
You came close to being the ex-Mr. Nuttall.
Wouldn't be the first death I died today.
We can't stay here waiting for them to catch sight of us.
Let's get to the boat down this way.
Sunk to the bottom of the briny.
And it sunk our hopes with it.
-Perhaps not.
-What do you mean, Peter?
-He's gonna take a bath?
-Yes, but not for cleanliness.
Since the Spaniards have been thoughtless enough to sink our craft...
I'll see if I can't persuade them to lend us one of theirs.
Your Excellency, facts are so often dull and deplorable.
Nevertheless, at the risk of boring you... it is my painful duty to inform you that 250 of my men... are now complete masters of the town of Port Royal.
Your most worthy islanders have been disarmed... and your city is now absolutely in the hands... of the forces of His Majesty King Philip of Spain.
Now that you have our city, what do you want with it?
For a price, I could forebear reducing it to ashes.
-What price?
-200,000 pieces of eight.
200,000 pieces of eight?
That's why we waited till this morning to put to sea.
We've a message for those Spaniards.
They are on their way now to receive it.
-Hagthorpe, man the guns!
-Clear deck!
-All ready, Hagthorpe?
-Aye, Peter, ready.
Give them a taste of their own iron!
You've done it, Hagthorpe!
Hurrah!
Didn't I tell you I was a gunner, sir?
You did that, you son of a Yorkshire steer... and bless your rusty heart, it's a gunner you are!
lt's the Governor.
lt must be that some brave party of citizens captured the ship.
I think you're right.
Someone should go aboard and congratulate them.
Yes.
My foot.
Since your gout so unhappily prevents you, allow me to be the one.
Go ahead.
You've always wanted to be governor anyway.
Don't be nervous.
-Man those sweeps.
-Aye, sir.
-Shall we hoist anchor, Peter?
-Aye.
Get under way.
There's another boat approaching.
lt looks like Col. Bishop.
-Who?
-Bishop.
The fool would come blundering in just now.
-I'll make short work of him.
-No, Hagthorpe, none of that.
But.... Who....
Welcome aboard the Cinco Lagos, Colonel darling.
You?
Was it.... Peter Blood, was it you, then, who took this ship and turned defeat into victory?
Myself it was.
Myself and these, my friends.
And your friends.
And you saved my money, too!
-Yes, it was heroic.
-Heroic, is it?
lt was epic.
You amaze me.
On my soul, you deserve well.
You all deserve well.
-You shall find me grateful.
-How grateful?
I shall ask His Excellency to write home to the King an account of your exploit.
Perhaps some of your sentencing shall be remitted.
That's just about what we expected from you.
Now, Wolf, Col. Bishop has a kind heart.
-But what kind, I'd hate to say.
-What is this?
Why, Colonel darling, such unusual generosity from you... must be making you feel unwell.
-As your physician, I'd prescribe-- -A bit of neck-stretching.
Lads, we shouldn't hang this man.
-No?
-No.
Tie him over the end of a gun!
I'll scatter his innards all over the sugarcane field.
You're wasting words, I say.
Hang him !
Wait, lads.
Hanging's too dignified for him.
Can you swim, Colonel darling?
We're giving you the chance to cool off some of that excessive heat of yours.
Over the side with him, men!
One, two... three!
Peter Blood, I'll make you pay for this... if I spend the rest of my life doing it!
And then the whale came, and the whale swallowed Jonah.
I hope.
Goodbye, Jonah.
Don't forget to write.
What's the next move, Peter?
Up anchor!
Wolf, man the capstan bar.
Hagthorpe, get the sails aloft.
Thomas, get those men over here.
Round you go, men!
That's no water wheel you're working.
-Can you handle it, Jeremy?
-Aye, aye, Peter.
We sail.
Hard to starboard.
Up that rigging, you monkeys, aloft!
There's no chains to hold you now!
Break out those sails... and watch them fill with the wind that's carrying us all to freedom.
We, the undersigned... are men without a country... outlaws in our own land, and homeless outcasts in any other.
Desperate men, we go to seek a desperate fortune.
Therefore, we do here and now band ourselves... into a brotherhood of buccaneers... to practice the trade of piracy on the high seas.
We, the hunted, will now hunt!
To that end, we enter into the following articles of agreement.
First... we pledge ourselves to be bound together as brothers... in a life-and-death friendship... sharing alike in fortune and in trouble.
Second article.
All moneys and valuables which may come into our possession... shall be lumped together into a common fund... and from this fund shall first be taken the money... to fit, rig, and provision the ship.
After that, the recompense each will receive who is wounded as follows: For the loss of a right arm, 600 pieces of eight.
Left arm, 500.
For the loss of a right leg, 500.
Left leg, 400.
A fellow can get rich if he's lucky.
Greedy.
lf a man conceal any treasure captured... or fail to place it in the general fund, he shall be marooned.
Set ashore on a deserted isle... and there left with a bottle of water, a loaf of bread... and a pistol with one load.
lf a man shall be drunk on duty, he shall receive the same fate.
And if a man shall molest a woman captive against her will... he, too, shall receive the same punishment.
These articles entered into, this 20th day of June, in the year 1687.
Now, men, you've heard the agreement.
lt's the world against us and us against the world.
''His hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him.''
Genesis 16:12.
Those of you in favor of these articles, raise your right hands and say aye!
Aye!
Blood!
This impertinent, ungoverned rascal must be eradicated.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Sinking Spanish ships causes me enough embarrassment... -but he sinks English ships as well.
-Yes, Your Majesty.
Cannot Gov.
Steed do something about it?
He does his best, but conditions on the island-- Silence, Willoughby!
I'm not interested in anything you have to say.
I know your feelings towards me.
Sunderland, what are you Secretary of State for?
Have you no solution?
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-Get your head off that hinge.
Speak up.
Since Gov.
Steed is incapable, you should appoint a stronger man.
Who?
Col. Bishop assures me that if he were in power... he would not rest day or night... until this Capt.
Blood was swinging on execution dock.
Angling for the office, is he?
What difference if he's the iron man we need?
Draw up the appointment.
I've already taken the liberty of doing so, Your Majesty.
Mrs. Steed, Mr. Steed, I wish you both a pleasant journey.
I thank you, Governor.
Again, congratulations, Gov.
Bishop.
-May your term of office be successful.
-Thank you, my friend.
Arabella dear, have a nice holiday in England.
I'm sure I shall.
-Captain.
-Yes, sir.
-Keep a weather eye open for pirates.
-Very well, sir.
Before you return, Arabella, I shall have the sea swept clean of them.
Particularly one.
I think you know whom I mean.
I hope he gets the gout the infernal office gave me.
Come along.
Goodbye.
Thomas Fulton.
One share, no injuries.
James Graham.
One share, plus 100 pieces of eight for a pike wound.
Zachary Stevens.
For bravery at the battle of Maracaibo... one share, plus 10 of silver.
Oliver Clark.
One share, plus 400 pieces of eight for the loss of his left leg.
There you are, Oliver, I'm proud of you.
Lord Chester Dyke.
No injury, one share and 5 of silver.
Anton Brazilimo.
Andrew Fell.
One share, plus 500 pieces of eight for the loss of his left arm.
There you are, Andrew, and good luck.
David Sampson.
One share, no injuries.
Honesty Nuttall.
No injuries, one share.
Hold on, Captain.
How about me little toe, heroically sacrificed in battle?
Honesty Nuttall.
One share, and nothing for the toe he just shot off himself.
You stupid numskull.
You should have shot out your brains and left your toe for thinking with.
Ahoy, the deck!
An English ship on the port bow!
So it is.
A fine big ship, too, as far as I can judge from this distance.
Shall we sail over and give them a surprise?
No, Peter.
The men are set on putting in at Tortuga.
Their gold's burning holes in their pockets.
What's one ship more or less to us now?
lt appears I have a mutiny on my hands.
What ho, the deck!
A ship to starboard!
lt may be a pirate!
Very well, then.
Sail on, little ship, back to England... where we may never go.
You'll never know how close you came to not getting there.
Your turn, mon capitaine.
Up!
It's your turn now.
Again, my captain.
-Are you ready?
-Right.
It's good.
This time, my friend, huh?
-You missed.
-No.
I am defeated.
You win the prize, Capt.
Blood.
-Goodbye, my dear.
-Goodbye.
What a charming captain.
Some other time, perhaps.
Why?
What sort of a man are you?
I'm the sort of man you like, my dear.
A man with money.
The money!
Mon capitaine, what a pair we would make.
ln all the Caribbean, there is no buccaneer so strong as me.
Except you.
You almost flatter me, Levasseur.
Why do you hold off your consent so long?
We become partners.
You've been in Tortuga these three, four months.
You must be even so much in need of gold as I.
Such a partnership requires sober thought.
My poor head has been dancing with rum this whole week past.
Even so drunk, your brain is the greatest this side the Caribbean.
With your brain and my strength, there is nothing we cannot do.
There's very little I can't do all by myself.
Long Iive Capt.
Levasseur!
And here's to Capt.
Blood!
Hurrah!
Then, it's a good dinner guest, my friend.
-You're next, Peter.
-Mon capitaine.
lt's clearly understood, then, that we sail under my articles.
Those very severe articles of yours?
Mais oui, I sail under the articles of a girls' sminaire... to have you as my partner, mon capitaine.
Women will be the death of you yet, Levasseur.
lt is a very pleasant way to die, even if it is expensive.
What is the first order, mon capitaine partner?
We sail on the tide.
Outside the harbor, we'll scatter.
Each ship will proceed singly to pick up any stray ships we'll find on the journey.
We'll meet at the island of Virgen Magra.
Magnifique!
I give you the toast.
To our great success!
Let me give one.
To the greatest captain on the Caribbean!
-Oui!
To Capitaine Levasseur!
-Capt.
Blood.
Bravo!
The articles aside, let's give a toast to Capt.
Blood.
Capitaine Levasseur.
To the greatest captain on the coast.
The greatest captain on the coast, is it?
Methinks the greatest captain on the coast... has just made the greatest mistake... the most ordinary common fool could make.
lt's been so lovely.
I'd like to stay forever.
You've all been so kind.
Come again and visit us soon, dear.
England is so much more beautiful when you're here.
-Thank you.
Goodbye.
-Goodbye.
-Thank you for everything.
-Goodbye, dear.
-Goodbye, Amelia.
-Goodbye, Mary.
However else the court may have changed, the art of flattery still flourishes.
Stab me if it's flattery.
When the King ordered me on this journey as a special emissary to the West Indies...
I looked forward with some trepidation to a life among the savages.
But when I found you were one of those savages... returning to your native heath, my grateful eyes could hardly believe it.
You pictured us running around in animal skins, eating raw meat?
Why not, in a country filled with Indians and pirates?
Speaking of pirates, did you ever happen to hear of a wild rogue named Blood?
-Peter Blood?
-Yes.
No.
I don't know him.
I hardly number pirates among my acquaintances.
Of course not.
Stupid of me.
I merely mention him in passing.
Because he's one of the objects of my mission.
-Your mission?
-Yes.
I've been sent to try to blot out all this piracy, my dear.
And in a manner I must keep secret till I find Capt.
Blood.
Ship on the port side, sir!
Yes, that's a fine ship.
-Captain, what ship is that?
-I don't know, Lord Willoughby.
She flies the French flag.
She could be anything in these waters.
-We're in pirate waters now, aren't we?
-Yes, we are.
Yonder bank of low clouds is the island of Virgen Magra.
-Exciting, isn't it?
-Very.
Could she be a pirate ship, by any chance?
Any ship we meet in the Caribbean could be a pirate ship.
Ahoy, English ship off port side!
Prepare to come onto starboard tack!
Starboard tack it is!
Steady at the helm !
Ready?
Stand by your guns.
What Iuck.
Just as I'm about to give up and anchor to wait for my partner, Capt.
Blood... this fine English prize walks into my parlor and says: ''HeIIo, Capt.
Levasseur. ''
-We've got to give welcome, Cahusac.
-Yes, and how.
Light it!
The ransom for you two is fixed at 20,000 pieces of eight.
I shall provide a boat for you... to go to Gov.
Bishop at Jamaica to collect it.
Meanwhile, mademoiseIIe remains with me as hostage.
I find it very lonely on this island.
I refuse absolutely and utterly!
You know this?
It is the rosary of pain.
lt is possible to screw a man's eyes out of his head.
Very well.
Do your worst.
AIors!
No, stop!
Lord Willoughby, thank you, but don't be foolish.
MademoiseIIe is right.
Thank you, miss.
I beg you to spare yourself and the young lady.
You know, I've been too modest with you... but since I have said 20,000 pieces of eight... eh bien, I have said 20,000 pieces of eight.
For what, if you please, have you said 20,000 pieces of eight?
lf it ain't the niece of our old friend Col. Bishop.
You don't recognize her.
Mind that.
What does he mean?
Your guess is as good as mine.
-Good morning, Levasseur.
-HeIIo, Captain.
-Cahusac.
-Capitaine.
I arrived late last night and put into a cove a few miles to the west.
We've walked across to give you good morning, but, faith... it seems we've interrupted some business of yours.
-Who are these people?
-Oh, yes, here.
As you see, two prisoners.
I captured an English ship.
Yes.
We saw her coming across the spit.
I must congratulate you, Levasseur.
I didn't so much as sight a sail.
The fortunes of war, my partner.
And these are also the fortunes of war?
Big fortunes.
A nobleman and the niece of the Governor of Jamaica.
Really?
I suppose congratulations are again in order... but have you forgotten there's an article in our agreement... forbidding the taking of women prisoners?
That's a foolish article of yours.
I was not aware you regarded it so when we signed.
Would you care to dispute my opinion now, your men against mine?
Not this morning, thank you.
As you say, a foolish article.
Heard, my friend.
That is why these are prisoners of my own, a matter personal.
-And the 20,000 pieces of eight?
-Their ransom.
-That is also a personal matter?
-lt is.
Obviously, these two prisoners, and particularly the young lady... must be kept in someone's hands for, shall we say, safekeeping... but why your hands?
Why shouldn't Pierre have her, or Roch, or Jacob... since she's as much their property as yours?
Or doesn't that please you?
You'd like to keep her for yourself.
And who might that be, do you suppose?
-That is your Capt.
Blood.
-Capt.
Blood?
Now, my captain... since you covet our joint property of war, you may have her... providing you're willing to buy her.
-Buy her?
-At the price you yourself have put on her.
20,000 pieces of eight.
The ransom is to be paid by Gov.
Bishop.
lt is for division when it comes.
But if the Governor should refuse to pay the ransom, what then?
No.
If you're to keep the girl meanwhile, pay the ransom.
Let it be your risk to collect it from the Governor.
Capt.
Blood is right.
-lt's in the articles.
-What's in the articles, you fools?
Where do you suppose I have 20,000 pieces of eight?
-Let someone buy her who has.
-Who?
-l. -You?
Jeremy, Wolf, bring the prisoners forward.
Here they are, Peter.
I bid 20,000 pieces of eight.
Can you improve on that, Levasseur?
I don't wish to be bought by you.
As a lady once said to a slave... you are hardly in a position to have anything to say about it.
-You want the girl?
-Why not?
And I'm willing to pay for what I want.
Cahusac, you boast a knowledge of pearls.
At what do you value each of those?
1,000 pieces each.
They're worth rather more, but very well.
Here are 12.
The three-fifths the value of the prize due your ship for having made the capture.
For the share due my men, I make myself responsible.
Now, Wolf, will you be so kind as to take my property aboard ship?
And that settles that, my captain partner.
-No, you don't!
-Stop, Capitaine!
Wait!
You'll not take her while I live!
Then I'll take her when you're dead!
-Capitaine, it has been honorably settled.
-lt has not been settled for me!
What is a girl, more or less?
Do not be a fool, Capitaine!
It's my business.
Two breaches in our articles committed by you.
You should be marooned.
lt's what I intended for you in the end... but since you prefer it this way, you muckrake, I'll be humoring you.
Up!
And that, my friend, ends a partnership that should never have begun.
All these things I've gathered in my journeys.
I've gone far since I was a slave on your uncle's plantation... thousands of restless, hectic miles.
But somehow tonight, I've got a strange feeling... that my journey's almost over.
You see these ankle rings?
They came from a ship that was out from Persia.
And these pearls... they're the choice from a fleet we captured off the Azores.
-Have you ever seen such pearls?
-Yes, I have.
They're like the pearls you sometimes use for making purchases, are they not?
-Yes, they are.
-How many lives did they cost?
As few as possible.
lt wasn't lives I was after.
-What, then?
-I never quite knew.
Some urge that drove me on.
Revenge, I suppose.
But I've had my fill of revenge.
I often wondered why I bothered to save all these things.
Tonight I know it's because... one day you'd be here in this cabin to wear them.
I'll never wear them, never!
Those nor any other plunder gotten by a thief and pirate.
Thief and pirate.
I've seen your pirate ways.
I've seen myself bargained for and fought over.
A combat between jackals.
But I thought you understood.
You mean you thought you'd bought me.
I suppose I should have regarded that as a compliment.
You pirates are used to taking without the formality of purchase.
I advise you to go back to your ladies at Tortuga... who are thrilled by your bold, lawless ways.
I only hate you and despise you.
I might have expected your thanks for what I've done this day... but very well, let it be so.
I'm a thief and pirate and I'll show you how a thief and a pirate can deal.
Once, you bought me for a miserable 10.
Now I've bought you for considerably more.
The amount's of no matter.
What matters is now I own you as you once owned me.
You're mine, do you understand?
Mine to do with as I please!
Capt.
Blood, Lord Willoughby sends his compliments... and requests you to talk with him at your convenience.
He's been sent by the King himself.
Tell him I'm not convenient to any friend of the King's.
All I've got to say is good riddance... as soon as I can get him to his destination.
I shall.
Jeremy.
Wolverstone.
-Wolverstone!
-What is it, Peter?
We're changing course.
Draw down every rag of canvas the yards will hold.
-Aye, aye, Peter, but.... -Jeremy!
All hands on deck!
-Jeremy!
-Coming, Peter!
Forever sleeping when I need you?
-I wasn't sleeping.
I was-- -Never mind!
Get ready to go about.
-Set the course for Port Royal.
-Port Royal?
But the English fleet is at Port Royal.
Col. Bishop-- Sweet, merciful heaven!
Haven't you ears?
Set the course for Port Royal!
-Make speed there, Wolverstone.
-Speed it is, Peter.
-Follow we a helm, west by north.
-West by north, sir.
Make speed there!
To your halyards!
Tacks and braces.
We head for Port Royal.
Make speed there!
That's the order!
Make speed there.
There's a gallows waiting for each of us at Port Royal... and no man should be late to his own hanging.
How you hate the villain.
lf I were a young man, I'm dashed if I wouldn't be jealous.
But you said you didn't even know him.
He was once my slave.
Slave?
Did you know him well?
I did.
He's not such a bad fellow for a pirate.
When he made his escape, I was thrilled and happy.
That was before I knew how he would use his freedom.
But aren't you forgetting... that a man's bitter heart may demand revenge?
That is the unforgivable thing: to have put his revenge above everything else... and to have destroyed himself.
That's what he's done.
I've seen pirates.
I know their ways.
Cruel, evil, greedy, plundering peaceful cities... torturing their captives.
Beasts.
Are you so much in love with him?
ln love with him?
That you care so much what he does?
I don't care in the least what he does.
Someone should, in view of what he's doing now.
But your uncle's with the fleet at Port Royal.
That much is fortunate.
Why?
What's this about my uncle in Port Royal?
He amazes me, this fellow.
That's where he means to take us.
-No, he can't.
-They won't let me near him.
He's alone on his quarterdeck in a fine Irish temper, I suspect.
-But I learned of it from one of the crew.
-Lord Willoughby, he mustn't.
My uncle is a hard, unforgiving man.
He lives in the hope of one day taking and hanging Capt.
Blood.
Capt.
Blood probably doesn't know that, of course.
I doubt if it'd make any difference if he did.
He's chivalrous to the point of idiocy.
Chivalrous?
And yet he's been what he's been these last three years... and done what he's done.
Lord Willoughby, help me.
I see your point, my child... but that's something you must decide for yourself.
Life can be infernally complex.
lt's hard to lay tongue to the right words.
I'll lay tongue to them.
We won't sail to Jamaica.
Them's the words.
Aye, Bishop's entire fleet's at Jamaica.
When you risked your neck in a duel over that petticoat... that was your business.
But it's our necks you're risking now, and I say no.
Not for her, nor a dozen like her.
I got a great affection for my neck.
I have no wish to hear it cracked by a hangman's knot.
This is what comes from sailing the seas with a lovesick madman.
We've been with you since the first, Peter.
We have a right.
You, too, Jeremy?
All right, lads.
What do you mean, Peter?
You told me we're not sailing to Jamaica.
There's nothing more to be said.
-Hurrah for our side!
-Quiet.
You sound like a rooster.
Good night, lads.
Wait a minute, Peter.
Where are we sailing for?
That's for you to tell me... since I'm no longer running this ship.
We didn't say that, Peter.
As Jeremy says, you've got the right.
You've been with me from the first, and you've been loyal and true... followed me into every tight corner men could follow another.
-But you always got us out.
-And none the poorer for it.
Yes, but on this occasion, there's no gold to be got.
Do you think it was for gold we followed you?
No, but I can see now I've not got the right to ask you to follow me.
The girl is my concern, not yours.
Are we gonna stand by and see this little snip laugh at our captain?
There's Bishop's fleet.
That might be paying a high price to keep from being laughed at.
We're not yet such lily-livered scum as to be afraid of Col. Bishop.
No.
That is, not very afraid.
Fie on you deserting our captain in this way... you scurvy traitors, you Judas Iscariots, you snakes in the grass... you wolves in sheep's clothing!
I was only with them to spy on them.
You'd better think carefully, lads.
Yonder lies Jamaica, and straight we sail for it.
-Aye.
And straight we sail for it.
-Aye!
-Ahoy, the deck!
-Ahoy!
I have sighted Port Royal!
Aye!
Port Royal, you say?
Aye, sir!
There's something amiss!
I see flashes of gunfire from ships in the harbor!
-Fetch the Captain.
-Aye, sir.
Bugler, all hands on deck!
lt's terrible to wake up at dawn dreaming of thunder.
That's gunfire if I ever heard any.
-There's a battle in Port Royal harbor.
-How many ships do you make out?
lt's hard to see clearly in the early morning light.
I think there are two.
lt's an attack on Port Royal, but who?
Pirate craft, perhaps.
Wish I could make out their flags.
-Perhaps I can supply you the answer.
-You can?
Yes, if I may speak to so inaccessible a person.
lf Port Royal is being attacked, they are likely French ships.
French?
You say Port RoyaI's attacked by the French?
Why?
When two countries are at war and one is attacked... who would it be but the enemy?
What's this?
France and England at war?
You mean you don't know?
Where have you been the past few months?
At sea, out of touch with the world.
The fire from the fortress is weakening!
One ship is already firing on the town!
That's strange.
Where is the English fleet that's supposed to protect the town?
lt's my turn to supply the answer.
lt's out chasing pirates.
Bishop would never let his fleet leave its post in time of war.
He wouldn't dare.
Col. Bishop, if I may say, is a very old and dear friend of mine.
-lt's probably me he's after.
-That fool!
Blunder!
And me in his own front yard.
Shorten sail there, Wolf.
Lend a hand forward, Andy.
Stand by helm and keep her headed two points to larboard of the fort.
Aye, aye, sir.
Get your men to their stations, Chester.
Port watch to stations!
Speed there, lads!
-Reef the fore topsail!
-Aye, aye, sir!
Take in the topgallant sail.
May I ask, Captain, what are your intentions?
Lord Willoughby, I set out to land you at Port Royal, but now.... Miss Bishop, an unlooked-for circumstance... prevents my landing you on your own dock.
But I trust that if I put you ashore on the beach nearby... that would be equally satisfactory?
-l-- -Thank you.
Only please understand, this is a bargain... your freedom for my freedom.
From now on, I no longer regard myself as a slave.
My life's my own... even though I'm a thief and pirate.
Capt.
Blood, are you, an Englishman, thinking of leaving... when yonder, an English town is being taken?
Hagthorpe, clear my deck and keep it cleared.
-Aye, Peter, we'll take care of him.
-Take your hands off!
-Wait, lads.
-Capt.
Blood, I must talk to you.
Very well then, Lord Willoughby.
Myself, I've the honor to be Irish, but part of my crew's English.
I was myself once, too, in loyalty.
Of what should we be thinking?
Of the chance to fight for your king.
To fight for my king?
Yes.
He was loyal enough to send me to seek you out... to offer you pardon for your past crimes... freedom from your slavery and more than that... a commission in his own navy for you and your men.
You hear that, Chester?
The King wants us to join his navy!
Read it for yourself.
Lord Willoughby, you're a guest aboard my ship... and I've still some notion left me from better days of decent behavior... so I'll not be telling you what I think of this offer.
All I'll say is, I wouldn't soil my hands with it... even though they're the hands of a thief and a pirate.
But this concerns you, too, my lads.
What do you say to serving the King?
No!
I'd like to serve him with a rope necktie.
I'd rot before I'd serve him.
I'd sink this ship with all hands before I'd serve him.
lt would appear then that my crew is still a little dubious... as to the merits of His Majesty's offer.
However you hate the King, England is still England.
And a bad king is bad king, and worse one if he's James.
James?
This commission is sent by King William.
King William?
Who may King William be and what's he king of?
I'm alluding to His Majesty, King William III, William of Orange... who, with Queen Mary, has come over from the Netherlands... and has been ruling England the past two months or more.
They've roused themselves at home and kicked out that pimple James?
Yes, and he's fled to France and he's in hiding there... and England and France are at war.
The English people will go so far, Capt.
Blood... and then they get up on their stubborn hind legs.
-And William sent us this commission?
-Yes.
He knows you're good men, wrongfully sold into slavery.
He can use good men in his navy.
lt's the long-winded fellow you are.
Why didn't you tell us this in the first place?
Bugler, summon the men amidships!
Men!
I've just heard a startling piece of news.
King James is kicked out of England and good King William reigns in his stead.
For me, this changes the shape of the world.
For you who were slaves with me... it means that we're no longer slaves.
That we once more have a home and a country.
For you who are English... it means a chance to fight for your native land... for I now propose to sail into Port Royal and take it from the French!
Those of you who are not English... will have to be content with fighting for Capt.
Blood... and the loot you'll find on the French ships.
-Are you willing to fight, men?
-Aye!
Have we an English battle flag on board, Hagthorpe?
We have every manner of battle flag, including a lady's purple petticoat.
Wait, I've a better idea.
When an English lion creeps up on a nest of French foxes... he wears a bushy tail.
Hoist the French flag, Hagthorpe.
Keep her trimmed by the head, Wolf.
Stand by the helm, Jeremy.
Forward, men, to your stations.
-ls that satisfactory to you?
-Perfectly.
Clear decks for action!
Capt.
Blood's orders.
You'll be put ashore with these men.
A ship is no place for a woman in time of battle.
-I want to talk to him.
-I'm sorry.
The Captain's busy.
-lnto the boat.
-Aye, sir.
Follow me, Miss Bishop.
Musketeers, to your stations!
A French ship.
Hope we get on them before they discover the trick.
-Andy.
-Aye, Peter.
Run to Hagthorpe.
Tell him to fetch all the hot coals.
-Put them by the guns.
-Hot coals, sir?
-No questions.
Run.
-Aye, aye, sir!
Stand by ready to fire as soon as we come amidships.
Stand ready to fire as soon as we've come amidships!
Open your ports!
Strike that French flag and hoist our own colors.
Man your port guns!
Ready, Hagthorpe?
Fire!
Hagthorpe, give them the hot galley broadside!
Aye, Peter!
Load them, lads!
Hagthorpe, keep pounding that water line!
We never miss.
-That's one ship neatly disposed off.
-Now for the other one.
-Jeremy, helm quarter to port.
-Aye, aye, Peter.
Clear away that burning wreckage!
-Port guns, Wolf.
Hurry.
-Aye, Peter.
Man your port guns!
Those French gunners must've learnt their trade in England.
That's their third direct hit.
Two guns out of order.
Ship's taking water below.
Replace them with two from the starboard side.
-Keep hammering that waterline.
-Aye, aye, sir.
Lower gun deck's awash, we're sinking.
What should we do?
Do?
We'll board a ship that's not sinking.
Get your men forward.
Aye, aye, sir.
-What now, Peter?
-Take the helm yourself, lad.
Straight into them !
-We'll never do it, Peter!
-Musketeers to the prow!
Grappling hooks to larboard.
Forward gunners, fire as hard as they can load!
Rapid fire, men!
Hagthorpe, double them up!
They won't take it, Peter!
They're blazing hot!
Up into the shrouds, men!
We're going to swing across on ropes.
When we clear the rail, come over the side!
Aye, aye, Peter!
You and your men swing across into their rigging.
When you see me cut down that French flag, drop down.
Up, men, into the shrouds!
Strong and sure!
Grapnels over!
All right, my hearties, follow me!
Follow on, men!
''Dust thou art, and unto dust thou shalt return.''
''Love thy neighbor as thyself.''
Leviticus 19:18.
-Hurry, Cato.
We'll be late.
-Yes.
The fleet's in already.
-Stop!
-Yes.
Capt.
Blood!
Miss Bishop.
I'll be on the veranda.
I thought you'd gone.
You can't be here.
My uncle's just returned.
-Yes, I know.
-You know?
-What are you going to do?
-Just stay here.
No, it's impossible.
You mustn't stay here.
-He's sworn he'll hang you.
-I doubt he will.
I've always been bad luck for your uncle.
You can't know the threats he's made.
The dreadful threats he's made.
His whole life is spent in searching for you.
-Now he's found me.
-But you can still save yourself.
Please, for my sake.
For your sake?
What do you mean for your sake?
Isn't it true that you hate me?
-Hate you?
-Or is it that you love me?
I'll hide you.
And tonight after dark, I'll find some way-- You love me, don't you?
Whom else would I love?
Now will you?
You love me!
Lord Willoughby, she loves me!
He'll be here any minute.
I'll hide you somewhere.
We'll hide together.
I know just the place.
How's this?
You must be mad.
He'll come here first.
Good.
I forgot to tell you.
The Governor and I are on the best of terms.
He lets me come and go here as I please.
Look.
-You can't arrest me!
-I have, by order of the Governor.
The Governor?
You are mad.
I am the governor.
You mean, you were the governor.
But we've changed that in your absence.
What?
You're broken for abandoning your post in time of war.
Who are you?
My name is Willoughby.
I'm a special emissary of His Majesty the King.
Lord Willoughby?
-You were informed, I think, of my coming.
-Yes.
Yet you went off on some wild goose chase after a pirate... leaving your capital at the mercy of the enemy.
Col. Bishop, this is a serious matter, as you may well find.
Seeing that you hold your office from James... it's even possible the charge of treason lies against you.
But, my lord-- I'm not concerned to hear your reasons, man.
-His Excellency the Governor will.
-The Governor?
You'll find him inside.
lt rests entirely with him whether you're hanged or not.
This is the fault of that scoundrel Blood.
What a reckoning there'll be when we meet.
Have mercy, Your Excellency!
-Arabella, why are you here?
-Uncle!
I have been pleading with the Governor on your behalf... asking him to be as merciful as you would be cruel.
Uncle, this is the Governor.
Good morning, Uncle.
English
The charge being... that you did willfully and maliciously attack a woman... namely, the wife of your own Captain with intent to assault and murder her... for which the punishment is the same as that for a traitor.
Namely... that your ears be slit.
No!
And your tongue be cut out.
And you be taken to the nearest uninhabited shore... with neither food nor water... and left to die.
Mercy!
Signed Capt.
Clegg... this year of our Lord, 1776.
"Praise he who made the sun" "Day by day his course to run" "For his mercies they endure" "Ever faithful, ever sure" "Praise him that he gave the rain" "To mature the swelling grain" "For his mercies they endure" "Ever faithful, ever sure" "And hath bid the fruitful field" "Crops of precious, increase yield" "For his mercies they endue" "Ever faithful, ever sure" Gentlemen.
This will not do at all.
We are gathered here today to give thanks to our Lord... for his bounteous gifts.
Now, is this the best you can do?
Surely not?
I know some of you feel you have precious little to be thankful for... with taxation what it is... and war with France more than just a possibility... but you are wrong.
For you have your health.
You have enough to eat.
More than enough, in some cases.
You have roofs over your heads... fuel for your fires, a new schoolroom... a choir that sings in tune.
Sometimes.
And what is more... you haven't any King's men billeted in your homes.
And so, my friends, let us have the last verse... no, the last two verses again.
And this time, we'll really give thanks and we'll mean it, shall we?
Are you ready, Mr. Mipps?
"Praise him that he sent the rain" Brandon, get ahead with your cutlass.
Aye, aye, sir.
Well, we've a good hour yet.
He said that parson liked the sound of his own voice.
"And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel... "were gathered together to Mizpeh... "the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel.
"And when the children of Israel heard it... "they were afraid of the Philistines.
"And the children of Israel said to Samuel: "Cease not to cry unto the Lord our God for us... "that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines.
"And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering... "the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel.
"But the Lord thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the Philistines... "and discomfited them."
Timed it just right, eh, Bosun?
Can't think why we didn't come by road instead of this boat caper.
He said they'd be watching for us on the road.
This way we take them by surprise.
Right, Bosun.
Forward!
Now... let us sing Hymn number 291: "Oft in danger, oft in woe."
"Oft in danger, oft in woe" Right, Bosun.
You know what we're looking for?
Pitch to and find it.
Brandon and Smee fallout.
I'm going to the church to make sure none of the flock leaves the fold.
Forward.
Aye, sir.
All right?
Yes.
Good morning, gentlemen.
We're closed till after Church.
Who says so?
I say so.
Mr.
Rash, these gentlemen must have had a long walk.
Give them a drink.
All right.
What do you want?
Brandy.
This is an alehouse.
All right then, wine.
We don't keep no fancy French wines here.
The duty is too high.
Don't keep any wine?
We'll have to make sure, won't we, lads?
Now, here's an answer to a sailor's prayer.
What's your name then, my pretty?
My name's lmogene.
Imogene.
I knew an lmogene once.
Chased her for two years.
Every time I caught up with her... she gave me the slip.
Perhaps you were too rough with your wooing.
Not for that lmogene: She was a three-master.
A pirate ship, she was, boy... flying the black flag of Capt.
Clegg.
We've got him in our churchyard.
Who?
Capt.
Clegg.
He's buried there.
You're welcome to him, boy, very welcome.
I see I spoke too soon.
The King's men are already with us.
If you would care to join us in worship, Captain, you are more than welcome.
But first, would you be kind enough to remove your hat?
I would, sir, if I were here in the service of my Maker.
But I'm not.
In the service of my King, I keep it on.
I had prepared a sermon for today on the text: "Blessed be the Lord my strength... "who teacheth my hand to war... "and my fingers to fight."
However, under the circumstances, I feel it would be rather inappropriate.
Therefore, I should suggest that you consider the service finished... and that you should go straight to your homes.
Well, nothing there, matey.
"Pitch to and find it," he says.
Where?
All I can show for my trouble... is splinters in my fingers and corns in my feet.
My heart bleeds for you.
Who's going to pay for all this damage?
Why, you are, Mr.
Rash... a right thinking taxpayer, you'd want to stop smuggling.
So we're putting a stop to it.
What more compensation do you want than that?
The follow party arrived, Bosun?
Aye, sir.
But we've found nothing.
What's in there?
Mr.
Rash?
It's here somewhere.
Unless that informer, Ketch, was lying, Captain.
He was too frightened to lie.
All right, Bosun, fetch your ferret.
Aye, Captain.
Unchain him.
Look at this.
So they've no fancy French wines, Captain?
You two.
Come in here.
Come on.
What's this?
A hole in the floor, Captain.
I can see that, fool.
What's down there?
Why, the cellar, of course.
Why the concealed entrance?
Well, it's an old inn.
Get down there.
No secrets here, Captain.
Just tar for the nets, lamp-oil and the like.
What's in that?
White varnish.
It's for the boats.
Are you sure it isn't White Holland's Gin?
Yes.
Open it.
He was speaking the truth, Captain.
Here, Captain.
Varnish?
Varnish, Captain.
Did anyone tell you different?
There's a man here called Ketch.
Do you know him?
Yes, that'll be young Tom.
I want to see him.
That would... Take me to him, no arguments.
After you.
Come this way, Captain.
They learnt anything?
Only the taste of white varnish so far.
At least that's all the Bosun has.
If we don't get rid of everything quick... they'll learn the taste of brandy and gin.
Listen.
Captain, I should have told you, I was at sea myself for years.
I've sailed around the world three times.
Pirating?
There you go, always suspicious.
No.
I was a ship's carpenter.
Very good one.
That's where I learnt my trade.
Of course, it's a bit quiet here, after the high jinks at sea... but it has its points.
What's down there?
That's the coffin shop.
But, Captain, you come here to see Tom Ketch, didn't you?
Tom?
Came in this morning, I haven't had time to touch him up yet.
He was alive last night.
How did he die?
He was found floating in one of the ponds on the marshes.
The Squire found him this morning, when he was out riding.
Squire Cobtree.
How did he die, man?
Dr. Pepper signed the certificate: "Natural causes."
But, I think from the look of the poor fellow, that he died of fright.
That's more like unnatural causes, isn't it?
Frightened to death?
What by?
Well, he didn't tell us, of course, being dead... but I think it was the marsh phantoms.
The what?
The marsh phantoms.
People around here don't believe in them.
Say they don't exist.
That's during the daytime, of course.
At night, if you ask them to go for a walk across the marshes... you'll find that they'll have something more important to do... like bolting the door and going to bed.
Old wives' tales.
I'm sure you know best, Captain.
You say the Squire discovered the body?
Yes.
Where do I find him?
He'll probably be in the church saying his prayers.
Shall I take you?
No, I'll find him.
As you wish.
Thanks, matey.
You out of your wits?
Bringing him here, risking all our necks?
I brought him to pay his last respects to the swab that gave us all away... the late Tom Ketch.
He's off to see the Squire now, won't be back for quite some time.
We're getting rid of this stuff.
Wait a minute.
That's the best elm.
I don't mind lending my coffins in a good cause... but I'm not having them smashed up.
Lovely bit of grain.
Throw the liquor in the creek.
Smash up the kegs, get rid of it.
By whose orders, Mr.
Rash?
By my orders.
We were told to wait, Rash.
We'll wait so long, we'll have a rope around all our necks.
Get rid of it.
Mr.
Rash?
Since when have you given orders?
Well, I thought with all those...
There's no need for you to think.
I think for all of you.
Is that clearly understood?
As you say.
Exactly.
As I say... the goods will be delivered tonight, in the usual way: At midnight.
What about the revenue men?
There's a chance they'll be gone by then.
Well, supposing they're not gone?
I don't like it.
I'm not interested in whether you like it or not, Mr.
Rash.
Just as long as you do as I tell you.
You've been in this trade long enough to know we all have to take risks.
It's all right for him.
He's done very nicely out of it all these years.
Yes, very nicely.
He's taken all of his fair share... and squandered it on food for those who were hungry... and clothes for them that didn't have any.
All right, Mr. Mipps.
Now listen.
Spread the word, the King's men will not get accommodation in the village.
There is to be no room for them anywhere.
Aye, sir.
And remember, there is to be no violence, either.
Aye, sir.
Mr.
Rash.
I heard you.
Then say so.
Midnight then.
He put you in your place properly, Mr.
Rash, didn't he?
No violence.
Captain, admiring our little church?
And you've removed your hat, I see.
Are you no longer in the service of the King?
I came to find the Squire.
But I'm also looking for quarters for my men, Parson.
Not in here, I hope.
No.
But you'll know the most suitable places.
Yes.
Have you tried the inn?
Come now, Parson.
There's only one room in the inn.
And you have taken that, I expect.
It's hardly big enough for all of you, is it?
Let me see now.
There's Mrs. Wagstaff's... No, she's just had another, hasn't she?
Her thirteenth, I think it is.
That would be little crowded, wouldn't it?
And a little noisy, too, I expect.
Would you mind holding this for a moment?
Thank you.
Dr. Pepper has a spare room... but he's been attending some rather nasty cases of the plague recently... so I couldn't really recommend there.
No.
I'm afraid the inn is about all we can offer.
Thank you.
I think the best thing you can do is march your men back to the ship... just for tonight, and then march them back again tomorrow.
We are staying the night in Dymchurch.
Are you?
I wonder where?
He certainly seemed to keep you fellows chasing... around the world, I must say.
Here's Squire Cobtree.
Sir Anthony, this gentleman has been looking for you.
May I present Captain... Captain Howard Collier, at your service, sir.
Not the one who sank the French frigate Lion d'Or at the mouth of the St. Lawrence?
Then you've heard of me, sir.
Certainly.
We're not so out of touch that we don't know something about our national heroes.
Squire, I should...
Your man has been telling me... you chased this fellow halfway around the world.
Capt.
Clegg, sir.
Capt.
Clegg?
So, this is where the rascal ended up?
Yes, I flatter myself that I gave him a run for his money.
But you never caught him, Captain.
Yes, that's true.
But... how did you know?
He was hanged at Rye, I attended his last rites as Prison Chaplain.
Last rites?
I suppose he repented all his sins at the last moment?
He died a Christian...
I interceded to obtain him a Christian burial here in Dymchurch.
Well, if I'd have caught him, he'd have a different end.
I would have had him hanged, drawn, and quartered.
Publicly, too.
I'm sure you would, but you didn't catch him, did you?
Well, I must be... Squire?
I may take you for supper, Blyss.
Delighted.
Thank you.
I should like a word with you... Not now.
It's important.
Very well then.
Join us for super.
At the inn.
8:00, sharp.
You honor me, sir.
Shall I see you and your men at Evensong, Captain?
7:00, sharp?
I very much doubt it, Parson.
Sailors have other ways of looking after their spirits.
"Sing a little and laugh a little" "Work a little Spend a little" What are you staring at, son?
I can tie that knot.
Want to be a sailor when you grow up?
No, I'm going to be a hangman.
I'm gonna string him up and cut him down.
We may have business for you, boy, before we finish here.
Have you all done staring?
If it's all the same to you, miss, I'd like a few minutes more.
Imogene, Mrs.
Rash wants you.
Yes, Mrs.
Rash.
You slip round the back and see if there is any more of this ale.
"Sing a little and laugh a little" "Work a little and spare a little" "Twiddle a little and put in the middle" "Let's drink up all we can" "Twiddle a little and put in the middle" "And drink up all we can" Harry!
You shouldn't come here.
Aren't you pleased to see me?
No.
It's not right for the Squire's son to be hanging around...
Hanging around the back of the inn to see the barmaid.
You keep telling me that.
It's true.
We'll go in then.
No, please don't do that.
If Mr.
Rash should see you, I don't know what he'd do to me.
He doesn't treat you badly, does he?
No.
But he's my legal guardian, and he could send me away if he wanted to.
If he should he guess that we're seeing each other... Let him guess.
Harry, give me that... Why should he object to me?
Wouldn't he like you to marry... the Squire's son?
Marry?
Lmogene, you know we will marry as soon as we can.
So you said.
I do love you so.
Yes, you've said that, too.
You said that if your father wouldn't allow you to marry me... then we'd be married secretly.
So we will.
We'd leave here... and go to some new place where no one knew or cared who we were.
So we will.
Then why don't we?
Because I can't.
You see, I might be in some danger.
What danger?
Lmogene, where is that ale?
Quick!
Don't let him see you.
Later?
I'll try.
I thought I told you to hurry.
Bringing it now, Mr.
Rash.
Wait a minute.
Has somebody been out here with you?
No, no one.
Where have you been all this time, girl?
The Squire's here with his party.
Take this in to him.
Hurry now.
Pigeon pie.
It always amazes me how Mrs.
Rash gets so many birds under one crust.
She's a Dymchurch woman.
What goes on under the crust of this village would surprise anyone.
Rash, bring out some Madeira and open a bottle of Chateau Lafite.
I have already taken the liberty of doing so.
Splendid.
One moment, Mr.
Rash.
I was told you didn't stock wines in this inn.
No, sir.
But the Squire generally keeps a few bottles... from his own private cellar here.
And a very pretty wine it is, too.
And a pretty duty it pays.
Or should, then.
By thunder, sir, are you suggesting that... Perhaps you'd like my cellar book?
I cannot believe he...
The Captain is only complimenting you on your choice of wine.
I hope you'll sample my little stock.
If you stay long enough.
I should be pleased to.
Where have you been?
You're late.
I'm sorry I'm late, sir.
But that doesn't answer my question.
Where have you been?
You left these outside, sir.
I was otherwise engaged, Father.
Wenching again, I'll stake my wig.
My son.
The free thinker.
Fair shares for all, and all that nonsense.
You don't get it from me, I can assure you of that.
What do you think of it?
What with that and his wenching... You should be very glad that he has an eye for the ladies.
It's high time one of the Cobtrees introduced some good looks into the family.
What is it, Bosun?
It's about the billets for the men.
What about them?
There ain't none.
There's not an empty room in the whole village.
Should I march the men back to the ship, sir?
Yes.
I suppose you could.
Just a minute.
What sort of men are they, Captain?
The sweepings of Chatham, I'll be bound.
They're as fine a body of men as you'll get.
Yes, but they won't object to discomfort?
They're used to that.
There is a barn of mine they can use.
It's around the back of the church.
The boy will show you.
Go see about it, Bosun.
Aye, aye, sir.
I do seem to have made rather a mess.
I better just slip down into the bar.
Mrs.
Rash will... give me a damp cloth.
I'm so sorry.
Excuse me.
Thank you very much, Squire, for the... On the way.
Give us a song, He can't sing.
We don't want no words, just a melody.
Give him the note, Dad.
Not until your song.
Go on.
One, two... Stop it.
Let him go.
Give us a kiss, then.
It must be the drink.
Can't think what's come over the heathen creature, Your Reverence.
Generally, he's as quiet as a lamb.
What on earth's happening?
My apologies, Parson.
Bosun, what happened?
One of your men got a little out of hand... but then our local ale is rather strong.
Please, it's of no consequence.
Shall I get the men outside, sir?
Sooner the better it would seem.
Yes, Bosun, march them off.
All right.
Come on, you rum-swilling rats, outside, come on.
Free thinkers, the lot of them.
This wouldn't have happened in the old King's time, you know.
Well, let's get back to our pigeon pie.
Come on.
I understand it was you, Squire, who found the body of Tom Ketch... in the marsh this morning?
Well?
Have you any idea how he died?
Dr. Pepper says it was heart failure.
If that's what he says he died of, then that's how he died, as far as I'm concerned.
More pork, Blyss?
No, thank you.
Heart failure.
It was rather sudden, wasn't it?
I don't know if it was sudden or not, I don't very much care.
Neither, sir, do I very much care for the tone of your questions.
I'm sure the Captain is only trying to do his duty.
Let him do it with a little respect for his betters.
Why are you so interested in this man, Ketch, Captain?
I might as well tell you.
Since he can come to no more harm.
It was Ketch who told me of certain activities... he knew were going on here in Dymchurch.
What activities?
Smuggling.
If there was any smuggling here, I'd know about it.
You forget that I am to be chief magistrate.
How do you think Ketch died, Captain?
Thank you.
I don't know.
All I've heard is some cock and bull story about being frightened to death... by phantoms.
Phantoms, ghosts, spooks.
You haven't heard, of the Romney Marsh phantoms, Captain?
Are they some local superstitions?
Don't tell me you believe in them, Squire.
Would you kill an albatross or set sail on a Friday?
No, I wouldn't, but... Local superstitions of yours, Captain?
But have any of you seen any of these so-called phantoms?
You, Squire?
You, Parson?
I know many honest men, whose word I trust implicitly, who have seen them.
I've seen them, sir.
You have?
What do they look like?
They were horrible.
Their horses seemed to move without touching the ground... or even making a sound.
Their faces were like nothing on this earth... glowing as if... they were on fire.
How many were there?
A dozen or more, it was difficult to tell, Father... they kept appearing and disappearing.
They disappeared 'cause they weren't there.
Except in your fevered imagination.
You'd change your tune if you saw them for yourself.
If I ever saw them, sir, it's this I'd change.
To water.
Now with your leave, I must see that my men are bedded down for the night.
Bosun, here we are.
Thank you, boy.
Here.
Give him this.
Lovable little creature, isn't he?
What happened to him?
He fell foul of Capt.
Clegg.
The pirate?
Aye, that's him.
He attacked Clegg's wife, so they say.
So they left him to die on a desert island in the South Seas.
But we were up on Clegg's heels at the time and we picked him up.
Lucky for you we did.
Is he always like this?
No, he's all right, in the ordinary way.
Tonight something seems to have upset him.
He ain't his usual happy self.
Get back!
See, he's frightened of fire, boy.
You know, he doesn't seem to like the look of you.
Some people have that effect on him.
And when he is like that... he'd just as soon slit your throat... or claw out your gizzards as look at you.
So the local people really believe in these marsh phantoms, Parson?
They're very devout here, they don't meddle with forces of darkness.
You're a doctor of divinity, don't tell me you believe in them, too?
I believe in the power of good and evil.
Good night, Vicar.
Good night, Mr. Mipps.
I know that strange, devilish forces do exist... with powers beyond the comprehension of mere mortal men.
It's best not to antagonize those forces.
I saw them.
What in heaven's name, man... Oh, God!
The phantoms... they passed so close I could have touched them.
Steady, man.
I saw them just as close as you are to me now.
I never want to see their likes again.
Where did you see them?
In the village?
Village?
No.
They're out there.
On the marshes.
They scared the wits out of me.
Where on the marshes?
Where?
North, south, east, west, where, man?
I couldn't say exactly.
Then think exactly.
Think, man.
He's had a terrible experience.
Out there somewhere.
How far?
A tidy way, about a mile or more.
A tidy way.
No faces... only skulls.
If you have all the information you require from him, I'll take him home.
He is coming with me.
He's going to show me these marsh phantoms of yours, Parson.
Can't you see he is ill with shock?
Then a walk across the marshes will do him some good.
Come on.
In the name of charity, Captain...
In the name of the King, I'm taking this man.
Good night, Parson.
Captain, I don't want to go back there.
Come on.
Pleasant dreams, mateys.
This stuff tickles, doesn't it?
Come on, mate.
Get your head down.
Come on outside.
Come on, you scum, let's see the color of your feet.
Get outside.
What's up then, Bosun?
You are all going for a nice long walk across the marshes.
That's what's up.
Now move yourselves.
Come on outside.
Come on!
Move!
Come off it.
Go to sleep.
Which way?
There, sir.
Right, lead them off, Bosun.
Right turn!
Forward!
Everything ready, Mr. Mipps?
It is, yes.
We'd better move quickly then.
I think we are about ready now, Mr.
Rash.
It's them, it's the King's men.
Evening, Captain.
Working late tonight, coffin-maker?
Yes.
These chilly evenings are good for business.
And if you lot were to get lost in the marshes, it'll be even better.
That wagging tongue of yours... will have us all dangling one day.
Just attending to business, Mr.
Rash.
All safe now.
Wait, I want a word with you.
Why?
What have I done?
It's not what you've done but what you might do.
You're becoming a danger to the organization.
You're losing your nerve.
I don't like the King's men around our necks.
Would you prefer the hangman's noose?
That's what you'll get us all if you're not careful.
I ought to be with the others.
You'll not join them tonight.
You'll go home.
Why?
I've always done my share.
Carried out my orders.
Come and see me tomorrow evening at the vicarage.
We'll be safe by then.
Where are you going?
Where are you going down there?
Of course, this is only the outskirts of the marshes, as you might say.
Once you get right into the heart of them... then to move as much us one step from the path is more then your life is worth.
Six good men we lost that year because they didn't watch out where they were going.
Now, the year before we had three... You keep us on the straight course... because where we go, you go.
Is this still the right way?
Yes, Captain.
Right enough.
How much further?
You've a long way to go yet.
You don't seem so frightened of these phantoms as you did.
That's 'cause I know we've a long way to go before we catch up with him.
And I've got you for company.
Now, as I was saying... Halt.
Bring that man up here.
How much further?
Not much further now, Captain.
I want to know exactly how much.
Maybe a mile, perhaps two.
You don't seem very sure.
I don't know this place.
But you came here less than two hours ago.
Or did you?
Well, I... Look!
The phantom!
There it is.
I don't like being made a fool of.
Bosun, your knife.
Hold his ears.
You were sent as a decoy to see us out of the way, weren't you?
To see us out of the way of your smuggling friends.
No!
You're going to take us to your friends now, aren't you?
I can't do that.
Bosun, cut off one ear.
No.
In the name of mercy, no.
You'll do as I tell you?
Yes.
Which way?
Bosun, keep close behind him.
Come on, lads.
Come on.
Keg of brandy for Maidstone... ditto Canterbury.
Odds are good.
The pack horses are here, boys.
I've got a score of kegs and bottles for you this time.
Come along, lads, don't waste any time there.
They say the King's men are on the prowl tonight.
They're off across the marshes on a fool's errand.
Good luck to them.
Thanks, Henry.
Be lively, Henry.
That man Collier is no fool.
Come along, boys.
We can't hang around here tonight.
Is that it?
Yes.
That's it.
The scarecrow.
He's signaled.
Here, that scarecrow.
Well, what about it?
We passed that way back on the marshes.
I swear we did.
Surround the windmill!
All right, Bosun.
Hey, that scarecrow.
It moved.
It moved, I tell you.
That scarecrow moved, sir.
Did it?
Blood.
Good morning, Captain.
Getting up an appetite?
I'm an early riser myself.
Would you care to join me for breakfast?
Grilled kidneys and bacon, I think.
Carry on, Bosun.
Thank you, Doctor.
Let yourself in.
It's not locked.
Party, forward!
Down in a moment.
Goodbye.
I always think this is the best part of the day, don't you?
Come in!
Thank you.
There.
What did I say?
Kidneys and bacon.
Delicious.
Come in.
Help yourself, please do.
Or some coffee first, perhaps.
Did you sleep well last night?
Exceptionally well, thank you.
And you?
You were out looking for the phantoms, weren't you?
Of course.
Don't tell me you've only just returned.
Yes.
Dear me.
You must've walked a long way.
Did you have any luck?
Yes and no.
That's comprehensive anyway.
Cream?
What did you find?
A scarecrow that bled.
Why did you flinch when I touched your arm?
It wasn't my arm, Captain.
You trod on my foot.
Captain.
What is it?
Captain, sir, Bosun says will you come at once?
It's urgent.
My apologies, Parson.
Good day.
Come and have some breakfast, Harry, you've earned it.
And you had better get these boots of yours cleaned quickly.
Must have jumped him from behind, done him in.
Got free and made a run for it, sir.
Yes.
No.
Come on.
What the... What happened?
Douse the fire.
What happened, sir?
Your mulatto, he broke into my house.
Smee, fetch the Bosun with the party.
And hurry.
I'll see that you're not disturbed anymore.
I wonder why he should break into your house.
When you catch him you might ask him.
He wouldn't be able to tell me, sir.
He had his tongue cut out by Capt.
Clegg.
Can you find your way home?
Without your spectacles.
Yes, thank you, Captain.
Good night.
Please take me away from here.
Somewhere where we can start a new life.
I can't leave here, lmogene.
Not yet, that is.
But you said you'd be willing to start afresh in some other place.
You told me that.
It's still true.
That's what we will do.
But I have to ask someone first.
Your father?
No, not my father.
Who, then?
Harry, please tell me.
Imogene, do you trust me?
Yes, I do.
I always have done.
Trust me a little longer then, will you?
If you ask me to.
Mr.
Rash.
Please get out of my room.
Not until I've kissed you good-night... and told you a little bedtime story.
The story of little lmogene.
Who are you?
You know.
I know what the Parson told me when he brought you here.
He said that your father was some brave Captain that was lost at sea.
He was.
He was lost all right.
To the devil.
You're the daughter of a common pirate that was hanged at Rye jail.
I don't believe it.
Here's the proof.
Your father was Capt.
Clegg.
Don't you fret yourself, my little pirate's daughter...
I'll not tell anyone.
I've always been respectful to you, haven't I?
But I've had to keep my real feelings to myself, until now.
Come back!
Lmogene.
Dr. Blyss.
I must see you.
Come inside.
What's happened?
Is it true that my father was Capt.
Clegg?
Who told you that?
Mr.
Rash.
Yes, it is true.
Does it trouble you?
Why, because of Harry?
We were to be married.
And now you think he won't marry you, is that it?
My dear lmogene, you underestimate him.
My father was hanged in jail.
A coward and a traitor.
Now, that is not true, lmogene.
Clegg was bad but he was never a coward nor a traitor.
Sit down.
He outwitted the entire British Navy for more than 10 years.
They never forgave him.
Did you know he was offered a free pardon by the King... for capturing a Spanish slave trader?
But he wasn't pardoned, they hanged him.
As soon as he touched British soil, the navy seized him and flung him into jail... and then hanged him without a trial.
He was betrayed, lmogene.
That's why he lies out there now in our churchyard.
He's taken the body.
You asked to see me, sir?
Yes.
Imogene's here.
She has some news for you.
I think she would rather tell you herself.
What is it, lmogene?
My father was Capt.
Clegg.
Yes, I know.
You know?
Dr. Blyss told me some time ago.
He asked me to keep it a secret.
You knew all the time.
Harry.
Perhaps you'd like to escort your fiance back to the inn, Harry.
Yes.
Thank you, sir.
What is it, lmogene?
I can't go back there.
To the inn.
Why not?
Mr.
Rash.
What about Mr.
Rash?
He'd been drinking.
He came into my room and... Harry!
Young Squire.
If you so much as look at lmogene again, Rash...
I'll kill you.
Hurt your arm, have you?
Did you hear what I said?
I wonder how you came to do that.
I said, "Did you hear what I said?"
I heard you, my fine young Squire.
So it's my little ward you fancy, is it?
I don't wonder at it.
Very generous girl is our lmogene.
Don't mind sharing her favors.
Get his knife, Bosun.
Go on, pick them up.
Take him outside to the horse trough, and sober him up.
Captain, look at his arm!
Look at it!
May I take a look at your arm, sir?
Cut yourself?
Yes, Captain.
Shaving.
I shot a scarecrow, and hit a man.
It was you, wasn't it?
Captain, I ask you.
Do I look like a scarecrow?
Take him in there and teach him not to be funny with me.
Drink, Bosun.
And now perhaps you'd care to tell me how you got that wound?
No, I wouldn't.
Hold it, Bosun.
These lads can get very nasty if they want, you know.
I wouldn't tell you, whatever you did to me.
No, I don't believe you would.
He'll be more use to us as a hostage.
Collect a party and take him down to the ship, Bosun.
He'll be safer down there.
Enjoy your bath, Mr. Landlord?
One moment, Mr.
Rash.
How did you know about the boy's arm?
I saw it, didn't I?
But how did you know I'd be interested?
I've got something here that will interest you, Captain.
I will give you this if you let me go free.
What is it?
I'll turn King's evidence if you will let me... Get up.
Bright lad, aren't you?
Get him to the ship.
Out, sir.
Keep him under guard until he comes around.
Who's there?
Mr.
Rash, what are you doing here?
It's all up with us, Mipps.
We've got to save ourselves as fast as we can.
Before they come for us, you and me, Mipps.
What are you going on about?
It's the King's men.
They've got the Scarecrow.
They what?
They've got Harry.
He'll tell them everything.
They've got Harry?
Where have they got him?
They're taking him to their ship.
You stay here, Mr.
Rash.
I'll go for the Vicar.
We can't wait for that.
He won't do us no good now.
Mr. Mipps.
They've got Harry.
What's that?
Keep the ranks, Bosun.
Get back.
Get back into your ranks.
Keep the men in formation.
Get back!
Hold on.
Bosun, after them.
Let's have a look at you.
I'm all right, sir.
Now listen.
We've got to move fast, Collier knows too much.
You mean we must disband?
Yes.
I had... Imogene's happiness means everything to me.
For her sake, and mine, I want you to take her away, now, before it's too late.
Take her away?
There's water in there and a towel.
Clean yourself up and hurry.
But lmogene... Imogene, quickly.
Now, wait for me here.
Harry.
Sir?
But why... You'll find out.
Come along, Harry, come on.
Mipps, all I need is a fast horse... Master Harry.
Imogene.
Dearly beloved, we are gathered together here, in the sight of God... and in the face of this congregation... to join together this man and this woman in holy matrimony.
To love, cherish, and obey.
Until death us do part.
Until death us do part.
And thereto... And thereto...
I pledge thee my truth.
I pledge thee my truth.
With this ring, I thee wed. With my body, I thee worship.
And with all my worldly goods, I thee endow.
For as much as Harry and lmogene have consented together in holy wedlock... and have witnessed the same before God and this company.
And have declared the same by giving and receiving of a ring... and joining of hands.
I pronounce that they be man and wife together.
God bless you, sir.
You take care of her, Harry.
Dear lmogene, be happy.
Get your men posted, Bosun.
Where is Dr. Blyss?
There are horses waiting for you.
I can't leave you like this.
You can and you will.
Now hurry.
The last time I saw him was about, I should think, at 10:00.
Perhaps even 11:00.
Well, let us say half-past just to be on the safe side.
All right, Mr. Mipps.
Thank you.
I believe you wanted to see me?
I've come to arrest you, sir.
On what charge?
And where is your warrant?
Have you issued a warrant, Squire?
No, I most certainly have not.
Captain, unless you give me the explanation you promised...
I shall have to report you to the Lords of the Admiralty.
Dr. Blyss, I should like you to answer a few questions.
Now, in front of the Squire.
Then you shall have your explanation, and I, my warrant.
In view of your cloth and surroundings...
I do not feel I need to ask you to swear to tell the truth.
I am ready.
How long have you been vicar of this village?
Ten years.
What were you before you came here?
A younger man.
I want a straight answer.
That is what I gave you.
Will you answer me or not?
I will.
But I must warn you I've lived a very full life... and the telling of it may take some time.
However, there is nothing I like better than talking about myself.
If you all have the time to spare...
I certainly haven't.
I'll see you in the morning.
This will not take long, Squire.
Dr. Blyss... you knew Capt.
Clegg, is this true?
It's hardly likely to be otherwise, since it was I who told you.
But you knew him well?
As well as any man could.
There is a story that Clegg's wife was attacked by a mulatto... and died in childbirth.
That is true.
And that Clegg left this mulatto to starve on a coral reef.
We rescued him.
This same mulatto.
Do you think he would be likely to recognize Clegg again?
More than likely.
You agree that it would be natural for him to seek revenge.
Of course.
Do you remember the first night you saw him?
Do you remember how he behaved when he saw you?
He attacked you, didn't he?
Why?
Because he recognized you, Capt.
Clegg.
Clegg was hanged at Rye.
He's buried out there.
He was never buried, because he's not dead.
Clegg's grave in the churchyard is empty.
He was hanged, yes... but look!
Lord save us!
Even your cloth can't sanctify the mark of the hangman's rope.
Capt.
Clegg, I arrest you in the name of the King.
Bosun.
Aye, Captain.
Wait!
You're right, Capt.
Collier, Clegg was hanged.
At least the rope was placed around his neck and the trap was sprung.
But he had many friends.
The hangman was in the plot to rescue him, and Clegg escaped.
But no man can stand upon the gallows without coming face to face with his soul.
On that day, truly the old Clegg died.
What the new Clegg has done, you all know.
When I first came here, I found you in wretchedness and poverty... deprived by harsh laws and heavy taxes... of the simple comforts all men have a right to expect.
I took upon myself the task of changing all that... at the expense of the Revenue.
What I did was for the good of you all.
Take him.
Let him go.
Come on, Captain, on your feet.
Come on.
This way, lads!
Come on, Captain.
You're doing well.
They'll never find us here.
That's right.
Come along now.
You're doing fine.
We're not beaten yet, Captain.
Here.
Just like old times.
Here, drink this.
Mr. Mipps!
Captain?
1 Madagascar... For centuries the bloodiest cock pit of all the seas.
Where the infamous brotherhood of the damned Waited to plunder the treasure laden galleons from India and Catay.
Then returned drunk with slaughter To their pirate stronghold, the 'Last Hope'.
Most ruthless of all was Captain William Kidd...
He encountered the great London galleon the Twelve Apostles... Commanded by Admiral Lord Blayne And approaching unsuspected in the guise of a peaceful merchant... By a sudden treacherous salvo he reduced her to a burning hulk.
When night fell... the Twelve Apostles was only a blazing funeral pyre... on the placid surface of a Madagascar lagoon.
Bless me!
There's a pretty sight.
It will be prettier still when the fire reaches the magazine, Captain.
Pity though.
Lot of stout seamen among them.
And they was with us for a long time.
We can none of us live forever Mr Boyle.. And dead men don't talk.
Man your oars, we've got this job to do before high tide.
There!
Dig faster, if the tide catches us here..
It'll save the Kings hangman some rope.
There ye are.
Deep enough to bury a man in.
Give us a hand, mate.
All ready, Captain.
Down she goes.
What are you waiting for?
Well Captain, that chest's been in your cabin a longish time.
We all thought as it would do no harm to open up that chest... And make sure that what was in it then... Is in it now.
I suppose you remember what was in it.
Aye.
I remember an emerald necklace that came off that Portuguese ship, El Vengar.
And all those pearls that we took from the big ship.
The Virgin Queen.
I remember a diamond medallion... We got from that Moorish galleon off Madagascar... And could we ever forget that silver casket With the arms of Lord Blayne that you claimed for yourself... After the taking of the Twelve Apostles, sir?
Your neck will be stretched as long as your memory one of this days.
Satisfied, gallows meat?
Put them back!
Lower away!
Now what?
Wait a minute Captain, there's something else you forgot.
What do you want now, we got half an hour before the tide traps us... That's as may be, sir.
We are all equal in this I take it?
Equal shares, yes.
That key then, what you put back in your belt.
That goes down with the chest!
Thus we start all clear and no favours.
If some some of us don't get back...
It'll will be that much easier to open for them that does.
Question me honor again would you, and I'll rip you... From belly to chime.
Are we such callous rascals... That we would leave a dead comrade...
Without commending his soul to his new master?
Here lies one who through treachery... And avarice... Would have placed in jeopardy the lives of honest men.
And here may he lie forever.
In the sands of Madagascar.
Rest in peace.
It's time to be out my lads, time to be away.
If a gentleman is a gentleman, he's gentleman.
That's all there's to it, sir I'm one of nature's gentlemen, but I need polish my good man..
If I'm to improve myself... A gentleman employs the terminology 'my good man'... Only when addressing lower servants... Or his inferior, sir.
You see?
That's why I need you.
My upbringing... A gentleman never sucks his teeth, sir.
Many a man's social career has been ruined by less, sir.
You seem to know your business.
I want the best mind and I can pay for it.
Hundred quid a year.
An infallible mark of the person of quality... Is his reluctance to pay his domestics high wages.
You don't say so.
Merely an idiosyncrasy of good breeding, sir.
Sixty... quid a year then?
You realize I have never been on board a ship before, sir.
Oh don't let that frighten you.
To the contrary.
In fact, since I was a nipper...
I've had a rather adventurous inclination... towards life on the bounding main.
It should be quite educational, sir.
You'll learn a lot, no doubt.
Is it a bargain then?
Very well, sir.
My hand on it?
Court Calendar Upon the solicitation of My Lord Bellomont... His Majesty is graciously pleased to Order... To Attend upon him at Hampton Court...
Upon the morning of November 13, at nine of the clock... Captain William Kidd, shipmaster, of New York... With intent to discuss a voyage of portent... To the waters of India and Madagascar.
Then...
It is your proposal, my Lord Bellomont... That Captain Kidd... Sail to meet our ambassador Lord Fallsworth... And give him safe convoy through the perilous waters of Madagascar.
May it please Your Majesty, yes.
That need a bold and adventurous man.
Bring in this Captain Kidd while we take the measure of him.
Captain William Kidd.
Your Royal Majesty.
And other Lords.
Bellomont, is this your roaring killer of Spanish buccaneers?
Nay, me Ludd...
I'm only a peaceful shipmaster who must do trade with other ships...
Without inquiring too closely about their business.
And it was so I fell into the hands of the Twelve Apostles.
A King's ship turned pirate.
In Madagascar waters?
I have never been in Madagascar waters, your Grace.
It was off the southern tip of Africa... Where I had gone to trade in elephant's teeth.
Who commanded her?
One of your admirals, Your Majesty.
Name of Lord Blayne.
He did turn pirating.
Sufficiently, me Ludd... To put fear in honest traders, like myself.
And if you are succesful in this voyage, Captain... What reward do you expect?
May it please Your Majesty... Having forfeited me honor in that I was forced to strike me colors to a pirate...
I want no reward but to regain it...
In the service of Your Majesty.
Unless it be, is it true... That Lord Blayne's lands are estreated and his title forfeit.
Yes.
All, well, all I ask is...
If I lay this renegade nobleman by the heels... Is that you honor the humble self... With his castle and his lands.
Is that all you want, Captain Kidd?
Not a farthing more, Your Majesty.
The fellow treats of a title so lightly...
He must be bursting with noble blood.
Though I confess he keeps it well hid.
Aye sir, you can no more judge of a man by his appearance... Than you can judge the extent of a nobleman's brains... By the expensiveness of his wig.
Am I to suppose... That the Captain of the King's Guard would deign to fence... With me?
Come, Captain.
Is your courage less than your wit?
Nay sir, I know nothing of the fence.
You must come at me... Quickly as though you'd kill me.
Very well then.
I ask pardon, Sire, I've a hot head when roused.
I only meant to demonstrate.
And to good purpose, Captain.
Your Majesty is satisfied with the Captain of our choosing?
I can think of none better.
I thank you, sir.
And now, Captain.
The main mission of your crew will be to meet a great ship.
The Queda merchant...
Which is sailing from India with vast treasures.
And to give her safe conduct, in my name... Past the perilous waters of Madagascar.
But Your Majesty... Will her commander accept me letter of mark as sufficient authority to... You shall have a letter to our ambassador Lord Fallsworth who's returning in her.
That he is to accept your protection.
And to submit to all matters pertaining to the safety of the ship.
And her treasures, Sire.
Oh yes.
And now, Sire... Me crew...
Your crew?
Captain Kidd wishes to recruit a crew from the pirates... Now under capital sentence in Newgate and the Marshalsea.
A crew of condemned pirates?
Aye, Sire.
There's none would be so loyal...
Nor fight so desperately... As cutthroats under sentence of death...
If they knew that at the end of the voyage... A Royal pardon would be in their pockets.
But I shall hold you accountable for their good conduct.
Between their conduct and mine, Your Majesty...
There will be little to choose.
And now, goodbye.
And God speed you.
I am but his unworthy sparrow.
I'd rather eat the bilge slime from an African slaver.
Adam, don't let your temper get you the lash again.
If I'm to hang I'll hang, but I'll go to the gallows with clean guts at least.
Hey you!
What kind of stinking maggots meat is this?
Wardens!
Wardens!
There's that dainty scum Mercy...
Complaining about the taste of the King's bounty again.
Watch it!
Bounty?
Bounty me eye!
The King's allowance is thrupence a day for food!
Not muck from the sewers of Whitechapel!
Making trouble again, hey Mercy?
I'm asking only what a man is legally entitled to.
Here, smell this!
Delicious.
Hear ye Governor!
What manner of a kingdom is this... Where a man is condemned before he's heard... And starved before they hang him?
Who is that quarrelsome feller?
Adam Mercy.
He was taken in a pirate ship by his Majesty's frigate Wasp.
He's always escaping, so that's why we keep him in chains.
He's got a lacing of tiger's blood in him.
This ain't exactly a flower garden, is it?
Oh, forgive me Governor!
These are two of me officers... Mr Boyle, Governor Landers... Mr Lorenzo, Governor Landers.
Spanish blood.
A pretty lot of sinners Capitan... Do you think there is anyone down there who knows us?
I hope not.
Governor, would you be good enough to tell them what we are here for?
Give heed you, you... vermin!
Her's news to your advantage.
Is the hangman dead then?
Out with it then, Jack nasty face!
Is it that your mother's turned into an honest woman?
Silence, you mutinous dogs!
If another man speaks I'll trice him up by the thumbs and flay him raw!
Governor... Is that the way to win the love of these unfortunate gentlemen?
Now, then me bullies!
Would you rather do the gallows dance... And hang in chains till the crows pick your eyes from your rotting skull... Or would you feel the roll of a stout ship beneath your feet again?
Aye.
Aye!
I have a vessel, the Adventure galley... And the King's commision to sail her.
And for those who show a loyal and a stout heart...
There's a Royal pardon in the offing.
Which of you knows the waters of Madagascar?
I do!
Would you have him unlocked, Governor?
Warden, unlock him!
Look you then!
I want men with iron in their blood... And steel in their sinews!
And the first up here is the first enlisted.
Governor, if your wardens are ready, would you be good enough to have them lower the ropes.
Lower away!
Here they come!
Make ready lads!
Put your hands on that, I'll make you a free man!
The other now!
Next!
Next one!
Come on!
Name.
Philip Shaftstow.
Philip Shaftstow, regardless of the fact that I'm your Captain... You will always address a gentleman as 'Sir', scum.
Aye, sir.
Make your mark.
On board!
Name.
Adam Mercy, sir.
Oh, so it's you.
Mercy.
That's a comical handle for a blade of fortune.
Mercy!
It's also something the world needs more of!
A quite and gentle philosopher.
You speak cultured!
Were you by any chance a stable boy to a noble house?
Perhaps.
I was also Master Gunner to a buccaneer you may have heard of... Captain Avery.
Avery's Master Gunner?
We needed a Master Gunner Mr Boyle, and from what I've heard... Avery was a shrewd hand at picking them.
The berth's yours for as long as you can handle it.
I can handle it.
Swivel gun or long arm, I'll forfeit a guinea for every miss.
You'll forfeit your neck if you miss while you're on my ship.
Make your mark.
And you can write!
We'll give you a nice bath!
Then you'll draw a uniform befitting a Master Gunner.
On board!
Next man!
Name.
Bartholomew Blivens, sir.
Bartholomew Blivens.
Make your mark!
There's no mask for a treacherous heart like an honest face... You keep an eye on him.
Down below!
Captain aboard?
He's over there, sir.
Next man!
That's all, sir.
Our complement's full Is it?
Holy...!
I thought you...
Yes, you thought I was dead!
I can hardly believe my eyes.
You mean you don't want to believe them.
Come, come Mr Povey, is that kind or is that fair?
As fair as what you did the day you abandoned me on a Bahama reef.
Oh please Mr Povey this is not the time to talk about that.
Oh, it's the time alright!
Unless you want me to go ashore and tell what I know.
In which case your present voyage is over before it's begun.
Now, now, now, now, Povey.
Mr Boyle, would you take over, please?
Mr Lorenzo, take the deck watch.
Come to my cabin.
My heart bleeds when I think of one of your delicate constitution... Having to fend for yourself on a coral reef, Mr Povey.
Come off it, Captain.
I know why you marooned me.
You thought there'd be only three of you to share, instead of four.
It's true!
A hostile wind did blow us away from your reef!
Between friends, we might have sailed back again...
But we did exactly what you would have done, Mr Povey.
So no more of your sentimental nonsense, please!
Now that we are four again, what then?
We are not four.
We are two.
Boyle and Lorenzo, dull clods.
Twenty thousand pounds apiece in their hands would only be spent in sinful ways.
Are you propose to remove them from the path of temptation.
How?
A knife in the dark?
I am not a violent man, Mr Povey, I detest violence...
But people have such an awkward habit of getting in my way...
I am an ambitious man, Mr Povey.
An ambitious man, if he be bold enough, can carve himself a kingdom.
I want to be a Lord, my friend.
And that for a commoner like myself takes a deal of money.
And that's why there could be two less to share.
Before we raise old England again?
You cold-gutted shark.
A flatterer.
Oh, I'm glad you're back in, Mr Povey.
You have no idea how gratifyng it is to have a congenial soul to confide in.
Thank you.
There's something I want to tell you.
I've left with a trusted friend in London a sealed letter...
Containing an exact and complete account of certain previous events... Only to be open in case, just in case of course... You should happen to return to England without me.
Of course, my dear fellow!
Very sensible of you.
Now I know you'll have a happy voyage.
I shall too.
I'll look up me quarters.
We are two of the luckiest man alive.
Just think... We are sailing for Madagascar waters.
We'll pick up the search where we left off.
Every officer on board has a servant.
I'll request the Captain to assign you to me, then we'd be together.
Yes, I've spent a good many years of my life at sea, Milady...
But I doubt if any woman minds a dash of salt.
Even in a Peer of the Realm, like myself.
Now, if Me Lady would care to join me in a minuet?
My Lady, sir, not Me Lady.
Blast me Shadwell!
Does one gentleman creep up on another... without a cough or a spit, or something to warn him?
I'm not a gentleman, sir, I'm a gentleman's gentleman.
Pity about the hair.
So you've tried everything?
Bear's grease?
Prenatal influence perhaps?
Dinner is served, sir.
Thank you, Shadwell.
Pardon, sir...
I'll show you to your place.
Captain, what's all this mummery?
You can forget your bilgewater manners for the time, Mr Boyle.
You are now officer on a King's ship.
So a man must starve while his manners fatten!
I know, I know.
And in a King's ship it is customary for the officers... to rise when the Captain enters.
That's better.
Gentlemen, be seated.
Well, well, well, what have we here?
You must not do that, sir.
Of course, but don't press me.
Come Mr Mercy, tell us something about yourself.
You already know whatever's of consequence, sir.
While under Avery I was taken by a King's ship and brought to London.
There I was tried for a pirate and condemned.
You were innocent, of course.
No sir, I was guilty!
You speak above your station.
How came you to go on the Account?
Call it love of adventure... Perhaps for love of scandal, perhaps a mix of all three.
And you've seen something of the world?
Enough sir, to dislike what I've seen and know there's small hope for a better.
Perhaps you prefer the next world, Mr Mercy.
You were close enough to it when you were in the condemned hold ar Newgate.
But I'm keeping you from your dinner.
And now gentlemen... A toast to the King... And since proposing it is a privilege of the youngest present...
The honor falls to Mr Mercy.
Mr Mercy, we are waiting.
No, sir.
Since I have little love for the King, I'll neither propose his health nor drink it.
Never the less you are on a King's ship.
King's ship or the devil's, it's all the same to me, sir.
I owe him nothing.
You owe him your neck Mr Mercy, if it were not for his bounty... You'd be dancing daintily on air at Wapping.
I owe my reprieve to you, Captain...
So to you I'll drink gladly, but not to William.
You stand up and drink to his Majesty's health as a King's officer should!
Or by fire and flame I'll have you shipped back to Newgate on the first vessel we speak!
Gentlemen, the King.
The King!
God bless him!
That's curious.
Do you suppose His Majesty put him on board to spy us out?
We've found him chained to a pillar in Newgate.
It wouldn't be to hard for the King to plant him there...
Yes, but why would he speak so openly against the King?
Your wits are even duller than usual, Mr Lorenzo.
Have you never heard of the serpent... That takes the colour of it's background, the better to strike?
Shadwell.
Yes, sir.
You have waited high born people and those of the courtship.
Have you ever seen Mr Mercy before?
No before this voyage, sir.
He has as high a spirit as a gentleman of quality.
I like him.
Would you find out who he is and where he comes from?
As you wish sir.
Thank you, Shadwell.
Foggy night!
Good evening, Shadwell.
Excuse me sir, but you seafaring men...
Always seem to be looking at something that I never can see... We are looking for something just over the horizon.
You know sir, I recognized you for a gentleman the moment I saw you.
What are you, a valet, doing at sea?
The Captain employed me to make him...
Socially acceptable, sir.
I'm afraid we're too far out for me to swim back.
If I can be of service to you, sir.
Did the Captain send you here?
Yes, sir.
Why?
He wants to know who or what you are, sir.
Who do they think I am?
Possibly a spy placed on board by His Majesty.
This seemed uneasy, sir.
This...
This Captain Kidd, how long have you known him... Have you sailed with him before?
Oh no, sir.
All I know is, he's a... Well, among other things... A merchant Captain.
A spy, that's strange.
Why should they be afraid to be spied on?
Goodnight, Shadwell.
Good night, sir.
Who is he?
Where is he from?
He's a nobody, sir.
He was employed by persons of quality... Where he learned his speech and his manners.
It's a matter of judgment.
If you fire on the uproll, the shot will go over his yardarms...
But if you wait for the down roll, the enemy is coming up.
Now watch!
Get ready!
Fire!
Hurray!
Pretty shot Mr Mercy.
Can you do as well with a 74 throwing grape and canister at you?
I have done it, sir.
Reload and secure!
And pick up your practice on the lower quarter swivel gun.
Mr Mercy?
If you sailed with Avery, you must know these waters.
Fairly, sir.
If we needed to careen and take on stores... Where would you recommend?
Ponticos Bay, it lies... We draw to much water, you remember Captain...
Remember what?
I only know the Spanish main, these are Madagascar waters.
Ponticos Bay?
Aye, sir Thank you Mr Mercy.
Come along, Mr Boyle.
You blundering ass!
Your presence is becoming increasingly irksome to me.
Get you below.
Now let's get down to the business of this voyage.
Hand me that chart, Mr Boyle.
Capitan, I have been thinking every day and every night.
What about that dinero that was buried in the cave?
What good is it there?
Let's get it back where we can spend it!
It stays where it is for a while.
Why?
We've got a fatter prize sailing right into our pockets.
Now!
Here is our present position.
Here is Madagascar...
Here is Calicut.
In June, the great galleon, the Queda merchant... Sails from Calicut... to England.
We should meet her.... About here.
She's stuffed from keel to gunnels... With treasure to the value of half a million pounds.
Half....?
And we are to give her safe passage...
Through the pirate seas.
By safe passage you mean we are to take her, Captain?
Now, now, don't be greedy Mr Povey.
I grant that most of what's in her may find it's way into our pockets.
But let's be fair, the King, poor gentleman, will expect something.
But however we do it...
It must be done... Legal like and honest!
Stick to ways you are familiar with!
Why, you pox riddled villain, I can be as honest as any man if I have the incentive!
Oh yes, me Lord Blayne!
Lord Blayne's name is not be mentioned among us Mr Povey.
He's dead, so is his crew and so's ours... And there's none outside this cabin that knows what became of them.
And if you all enjoy living... You will remember that!
Well!
Here's to our meeting with the Queda merchant!
Queda merchant!
Queda merchant!
God bless her!
Wind fresh from West North-West, sir.
Course North-East by East, night dark but clear.
Very well, Mr. Mercy.
North-East by East.
North-East by East, sir.
It's Mr Boyle!
Help me!
Lend a hand men!
Man down!
What happened?
He is dead.
If I find the man that's responsible for this, I'll hang him.
Fetch the yard and re-set it!
What do you suppose happened?
Someone's been tampering with this lines.
We are gathered together to say farewell to a gallant seaman and a stout comrade.
Here was a man, shipmates... Whose heart, the flinty mountains could not match... Who always took better than he gave.
Whose benevolence was such...
The orphan's might and the rich man's gold alike... Found refuge in his pocket.
A jealous Providence removed him from our midst... An' I esteem it a privilege to commit his body to the deep!
We shall all mourn him.
Aye, we shall mourn him, but take comfort my friends... We shall never see his like again.
Rest in peace.
Pop him over.
Pity, Mr Mercy, a great pity, but the ship's work must go on.
Move your gear into poor Mr Boyle's cabin... You will take his place as Master.
As Master!
Aye, sir.
Why, Shadwell!
Don't tell me after all this time at sea... My inward revolt is not for the movement of the vessel, sir... Is occasioned by the company I endure.
The manners I say nothing of, sir.
But I am a Dorcestershire man... And when I find a common ship's master... Has the presumption to copy himself the coat of arms... Of one of our best Dorcestershire families.
Can you wonder if I am physically upset?
Whose crest was he copying?
Credit it or not, sir, the Blayne crest.
Are you certain?
Perfectly, sir.
Pardon me sir, I must join the captain.
He's inspecting a cask of pickled eels... With Mr. Lorenzo.
Well, Mr. Mercy!
Do your new duties include robbing my desk?
Shoot me Captain and your head goes with it.
I'm here by the King's order.
So he did plant you on board!
Do you think he would let a man sail with a crew of cut-throats... And not keep tabs on him?
And with good reason...
If anything ever reaches the Palace it is those, and murder, Captain!
Boyle's death was no accident.
By the way... What ship was sunk here, the Twelve Apostles?
Why the Twelve Apostles, Mr Mercy?
Here's Blayne's ring, his name is on it, and he commanded the Twelve Apostles.
That will make interesting telling in London when we get back, Captain.
If you get back...
When I get back, for if I don't... On the other hand... On the other hand, what?
Since a man doesn't exactly grow rich in the King's pay... A crooked rogue!
So you have your price... How much?
An equal share in what's buried here.
Share that with you?
I'll be hanged if I do!
You'll be hanged if you don't!
Of all the slumocky blaggards... And if you do share, Mr King's informer... What guarante is there that you won't...
Still turn evidence to the Crown?
If I go in with you, I am equally guilty.
And if we are caught... We hang together, but...
I can keep you from beeing caught.
What more could you ask?
You know, Mr Mercy...
I wondered sometimes if ever I'd meet a more unscrupulous blaggard... Than myself... And I have.
But let's be sensible about it... Who knows... We might be useful to each other one day...
In one way or another.
You've forgotten something.
The ring!
So I have!
Listen in carefully because I want you to tell it in London if anything happens to me... Kidd caught me in his cabin robbing his desk.
I lied to him and told him I was a King's informant... Good!
Yes but he didn't believe me, not one word, he just pretended to.
Oh, why didn't you shoot him?
Then he would give us no more trouble.
If he proves the liar I think him... King's man or no, he betrayed an uncommon interest in the Twelve Apostles.
I didn't like that Mr Lorenzo and I mean to find out why.
Why you could have charged him of robbery and turned him off to the yardarm... And all legal and shipshape!
You would've been rid of him once and for all.
Let's not be impetuous, Mr Povey.
He can't leave us, unless he swims.
It'll be rather amusing to find out what he does.
You rest easy, leave Mr Mercy to me.
Sail ho-ho!
Sail ho-ho!
Have the bosun pipe the chorus.
Pipe the chorus!
The Queda merchant, sure enough.
Can you make her out, Captain Rawson?
She hasn't the cut of a buccaneer, Your Excellency.
Much too tidy for that, more like a King's ship.
Yet she has the lines of a merchantman.
Have the longboat ready and manned.
Longboat off board!
Stand by to puty a shot across her bows, Mr Mercy.
Aye, sir.
Number four gun crew stand by for action!
She's fllying the English colours.
Perhaps she is our escort ship.
It was about here we were to meet wasn't it?
Though we make it certain just the same.
Mr Gillian, keep it all hands at their stations.
Very good, sir.
Ready?
Fire!
Well placed Mr Mercy.
Hard to starboard!
Hard to starboard!
Starboard she is, sir.
You will come across with us in the longboat, Mr Mercy.
And pay my compliments to all officers, who will dress as befitting a King's ship.
Aye, sir.
Captain William Kidd of his Majesty's privateer Adventure... At your service, sir Mr Povey me surgeon... Mr Mercy me master... Mr Lorenzo me navigator.
Welcome aboard, gentlemen.
I'm Captain Rawson.
I am Lord Fallsworth... His Majesty's ambassador at the court of the Grand Mogul.
Your obedient servant, sir.
I have been sent to give you convoy, and we better make haste with our business.
These are unhealthy waters, the ship could be hove to.... As I discovered a day or so ago.
You mean you sighted some of the pirate brotherhood?
More than that, sir.
We beat off two of them.
Avery and Culliford... Out of Last Hope, some thirty leagues South of here.
Oh I nearly forgot, could you spare us some powder... For we used more then expected in the action?
Why, all that you need sir, and welcome.
Mr Lorenzo here could attend to that then?
Mr Gillian, take Mr Lorenzo below and see to that he gets what he wants.
Aye, aye, sir.
Captain!
Mr Stanson's the master gunner, he will take care of all your needs.
Mr Lorenzo!
Take this powder and put it in the longboat.
Aye, aye, sir.
Gentlemen, my daughter.
The Lady Anne Dunstan.
Captain Kidd... Mr Povey, Mr Mercy.
Haven't we met before?
I think not, My Lady.
You remind me of someone I've seen.
I... think it impossible that we could have ever met.
Perhaps.
How do we proceed now, Captain?
Well, I am instructed to give you protection past Madagascar.
And you'll be safe as long as we sail in company.
But Avery will be a wolf at your heels and if we are separated...
In darkness or storm... And what would you advise then, sir?
Well...
I suppose we could take Lord Fallsworth and Lady Anne...
Aboard the Adventure to Madagascar... And then if we are separated and this...
Vessel should be taken... What about the treasure on board?
One silver chest alone... A present to His Majesty from the Grand Moghul...
Contains precious gems valued at more than a million pounds!
May I suggest, your Excellency... Why not transfer the treasure chest with yourself and Lady Anne...
Aboard the Adventure until we are out of danger?
She is a King's ship.
That is a great responsibility.
And although my instructions are that you are to trust me in all matters...
I don't know if I could go so far as... What else can we do?
Three of them against us?
Or even two, sir... We'd be helpless!
It's the wisest course!
It defer to your Excellency.
Now could we inspect the chests?
We could have them slung into our boats along with the gear of Lord Fallsworth and Lady Anne.
Why, certainly!
This way, Captain.
No trouble at all!
Hoist away!
Mr Povey!
I've sent for the manifest, Captain.
You may check it against the content of this chest and give me your receipt, if you will.
Gladly, gladly.
Oh, there you are Mr Lorenzo!
Have you completed your business?
Almost, sir.
Your people have been most kind, Capitan Rawson.
There is only one detail left.
It will not take a minute.
Finish it up then.
We must be gone within the hour.
Yes, Capitan!
The manifest, sir.
Would you attend to that Mr Povey?
Thank you very much, Captain.
Come Mr Lorenzo!
You've seen a lovely lady before this!
A tribute to your beauty, Ma'am!
Did you finish your business below?
Yes, Capitan.
Then we better be under way!
Mr Mercy, you will see Lord Fallsworth and the Lady Anne into the boat.
Aye, sir.
Make way for the longboat!
You will look after the luggage, Mr Lorenzo.
I apologize My Lady for our poor accommodation.
But me valet Shadwell will see that you are made comfortable.
A pleasure to have your Ladyship aboard.
If you will follow me, please.
Why hasn't it happened?
Release that chest!
Captain!
Papa!
Excuse me My Lady.
Your father.
May I say how sorry I am.
The captain has requested that you take your meals in the main cabin.
Oh no Shadwell, I can't bear to face those men.
I can't!
I quite understand My Lady.
But the Captain's orders are orders.
Shadwell, you must help me, there's no one else I can trust!
What can I do, My Lady?
I'm only a servant.
Where can I turn?
I'm so confused and frightened!
I keep thinking of my father and the others lost back there.
But on this ship wherever I go, those horrible staring men... Like Lorenzo, who's always standing behind me, beside me!
Last night there was a tapping on the door...
When I opened it there he was!
The evil smiling face of his!
We might have been better along with those pirates you fought a few days ago!
Pirates, Milady?
We fought no pirates.
Well my father said Captain Kidd... Shadwell, what manner of ship this is?
My father was killed deliberately, I'm sure of it!
That's why I can't bear to face your Captain.
I'd accuse him!
There's a man on board, My Lady... A gentleman.
Whom I know you can trust.
Mr Mercy?
Yes, MY Lady.
Shadwell, I know I've met or seen him before, no matter how he denies it.
His name isn't Mercy... Who is he?
All I really know is My Lady, he is no friend of the Captain's.
Perhaps if I ask him, he'll... Shall I?
Oh yes, will you please!
Yes, My Lady.
I'm asking you again very nice... My dear Capitan...
Your fancy manners do not impress me, Mr Lorenzo.
When do we divide the gold?
In London, not before!
Then look Capitan, I'll make a bargain with you.
A bargain?
Everybody wants to bargain with me.
You and Mercy!
Who do you think I am, a stinking sausage merchant?
What kind of a bargain?
The girl.
All my life I've dreamed of a beautiful woman like that.
Give me half of my dinero now... And you can split the rest between you.
If you will let me have her.
Pity on him!
He's smitten with love.
Again!
I want her... And I'm going to take her.
Whether I like it or not?
With all this treasure on board...
The crew is like a barrel of hot gunpowder.
All that is needed is a word in the right ears.
Do you mean mutiny?
You're a witness!
He is inciting the crew to mutiny.
No, no, no, no, Capitan!
I was only joking.
You have a very nasty way of joking, Mr Lorenzo.
As for the girl, I have my own plans for her and they do not include you.
Get out.
Who is it?
Adam Mercy.
Mr Mercy, I...
Thank you for coming, Mr Mercy, I... My name is Adam Blayne.
Son of Lord Blayne?
I knew it, I knew.
What are you doing on this ship?
My father was killed and accused of piracy.
Few people believe that Lord Blayne...
The King did.
That's why I went to sea and turned pirate three years ago.
That's why I'm on this ship.
I knew that someday I'd come upon the truth.
And you have?
It was Captain Kidd who killed your father, wasn't it?
Adam I am no fool!
He did the same thing to my father!
The fat butcher!
It's taken me three years to track him down.
Three years of degradation.
Now I got him where I want him and he knows it.
Do you mean he knows who you are?
He knows something.
That's why you didn't get me to know you.
Why you avoided me.
If Kidd knew we shared this he'd kill you with as little compunction as he means to kill me.
If I'd let him.
What can I do to help you?
There must be something!
Forget everything you've seen on this ship.
Play up to him.
Be friendly.
That way you'll be safe.
Now, when you get back to London, no matter what has happened to me... Go to the Lord of the Admiralty and the King.
You'll be doing me a great favour, as well as you know.
I will, Adam, I promise.
We're going to have trouble with Lorenzo.
He's speaking as a lion who's exciting the tiger.
His blood's getting too rich for him.
He'd be the better for a bleeding.
Things are getting a bit complicated me Lord.
The King may accept the elimination of the Queda merchant as an accident.
Maybe even the sudden demise of Lord Fallsworth...
But what about the Lady?
You said you had plans for her.
Do they include... Mr Povey, the little dear is as safe with me as if she was me daughter.
My passion's power and gold.
Since she suspects nothing...
I'll deliver her to His Majesty along with his share of the Queda merchant's gold...
I'll weep appropriately over the untimely demise of her Pa...
Receive the grateful thanks of me Sovereign... And a peerage is mine.
Milord!
That is your will, but that's what I'll have!
And neither man nor devils shall stop me!
Shadwell.
Seorita, Milady.
Do not be alarmed.
Now that she knows who I am and what kind of a ship she's on...
I think we can count on her to keep her head.
You stay here till I come off watch.
Help!
Shadwell!
Use your head Mr Povey!
Luck is with us tonight.
Which of either of them would you like to see survive?
Mr Mercy, you did well to protect her.
Are you alright, sir?
Yes I'm alright.
Look after Lady Anne.
Shadwell.
Adam, what's the matter?
My medallion is gone!
Has the Blayne crest on it.
Blayne?
Perhaps I can find it for you, sir.
No!
It must have come off just before Lorenzo went through the port.
Shadwell, take Lady Anne to her cabin.
Please Adam, I can't go in there!
You must Anne, this is serious, it involves you.
Remember, no matter what tricks he tries... You've never seen me before and you don't know who I am.
Shadwell I think... Don't worry about me, sir.
He never could get anything out of me and he never will.
It's the only way you'll be safe.
Shadwell will watch out of you.
What about you, Adam?
What will he do?
The same thing he's done with the others, if he gets a chance.
Oh Adam!
Don't worry Anne.
At least I know what to expect.
Go now.
Shadwell, if anything does happen...
Remember you're to stand by Lady Anne and see that she gets safely to London.
I'll stake my life on it, sir.
I know you will.
Be careful, Adam.
Please be careful!
Come My Lady.
He's no King's man.
Who is he then?
Tomorrow we put into the lagoon for water.
While the crew is getting it on board, you and me, and Mr Mercy... Is going to the cave.
You aren't taking him there?
I have a peculiar humour to watch my clever young friend's face...
When we dig up that chest.
Sweet dreams.
Dig fast Mr Mercy, we haven't got forever.
Who might this be?
Perhaps a man that asked too many questions.
Gently now, Mr Mercy.
You've came on something.
THE TWELVE APOSTLES So it was the Twelve Apostles, hey Captain?
Yes it was, Mr Mercy.
Open it up.
Blayne's!
Blayne's.
He was a brave seaman, but foolish... Did you happen to know him, Mr Mercy?
I've heard of him.
I thought perhaps you had.
This... Is yours.
Isn't it?
I...
Traded a ring for it... One of Avery's men.
Yes!
When I encountered Lord Blayne at sea...
I did my simple duty as a loyal subject... A pity he turned pirate and traitor to his King.
Liar!
He's meat for the sharks now, Mr Povey!
The tide closes this place in half an hour.
We've nothing more to fear.
Yes you have, Captain.
Lady Anne!
It's a long voyage home Mr Povey... And anything might happen.
Naturally her Ladyship is still very distressed, sir.
In the midst of life we are in death, Shadwell.
Although me heart... My heart, sir.
My heart bleeds... Confound you Shadwell!
You've driven the thought right out of me, and it was an uncommon pretty one!
I'm sure of that, sir.
Go to her at once!
Tell her she can't mourn forever... And I shall expect her to take her meals in the main cabin with the rest of us.
Very well, sir.
Poor lad!
We turned just in time to see him go over the edge.
Searched for an hour, never came out.
Well...
Here's to him!
Wherever he is.
You sick Lady Anne?
Yes, sir.
I'll go to my cabin with your permission.
If you wish, it has been quite a trying voyage... What with one little thing or another, but bear up!
You'll soon be home again.
I warned Adam not to go.
No one could've stopped him.
It was cold bloody, planned, deliberate.
The same will happen to her Ladyship, unless we can... Adam!
Adam!
How did you?
If he finds you on board...
I've come back for Lady Anne.
Oh thank you, sir.
I have been hanging on the rudder chain since dark waiting for the turn of the watch.
The jollyboat's moored astern.
I've had it along side, it's secured right down this port.
Why, get in it then.
Flip it aft under the main cabin... Well now, get me some dry clothes.
Shadwell, where is the captain?
In his own cabin with Mr Povey, sir.
Examining the silver chest they brought back on board, sir.
My father's chest!
Shadwell, Kidd doesn't suspect you.
Tell Lady Anne to get some things together... And when the coast is clear you come back for me.
Yes, sir.
Master!
Aye, sir.
Rouse out both watches at daybreak!
We'll weigh on the morning tide.
Aye, sir.
Adam!
Kidd doesn't suspect Shadwell...
He is staying on board and he'll be evidence for us in London.
Bart has a small boat moored astern, we'll row ashore.
Then where Adam?
Two days journey overland is the pirate town of Last Hope.
It's the most lawless place on earth, but I have friends there.
Somehow they'll find us a ship for England.
England.
Now!
Come on!
Sit down in the bow.
Goodbye, My Lady.
Goodbye, My Lord.
Godspeed!
I'll see you in England!
Ahoy there!
Who's in that boat now!
Come on!
Come on!
Fire!
Thank you.
Melord!
Fire!
Down the longboat!
Bart!
Bart!
Hold on to me!
Take her away!
They're as dead as a mackerel!
He's gone through!
Now, I guess that's the end of them, Captain.
And good riddance!
Back to the ship boys!
If you are thinking what I think you're thinking my friend, forget it.
There's the little matter of a letter I've left in London.
Spoilsport!
Captain William Kidd!
Greetings, Captain!
What news have you brought me from the Indian seas?
By your leave Your Majesty, both good and ill, but mostly very good indeed.
I returned by way of the American colonies, Sire.
So I understood.
With the main points of your voyage, I am familiar.
I wonder if you could enlighten me... About the affair of the Queens godchild Lady Anne Dunstan and your shipmaster Mr Mercy?
Oh that poor impetuous fellow, Sire... Inveigled that bud of innocence, he did, into running away with him.
And catching him red handed in defence of me very life...
I was forced to dispatch them both.
Rest in peace.
Tell me Captain about the treasure... And the Queda merchant.
Unfortunate, Sire.
Most unfortunate.
The ship with that chest, well, up she blew... And all souls went heavenward.
Rest in peace to them.
Ditto.
I see.
And after Twelve Apostles and Lord Blayne... Did you encounter any trace?
Nay, Sire.
I can only hope that the weight of his sins sank both him and his ship.
I see.
Then how do you explain this?
Whose might that be, Your Majesty?
My officers found it on your ship at Plymouth after you left for London.
It bears the Blayne crest, with which I believe you are not unfamiliar.
I've always thought that Mr Povey, me surgeon, a very wily fellow indeed was hiding something from me.
Hide it in a secret locker in your cabin Captain?
I hope Mr Povey has a proper explanation, Sire.
Mr Povey was killed three days ago defending it.
With his dying oath he swore it was not his.
Perhaps Shadwell, me vallet slipped it aboard.
Might it not have come from a Madagascar cave, Captain?
The facts will clear me about all this, Your Majesty.
Enough of your lies!
Look!
A nightmare!
A pity you overlooked Last Hope, Captain!
We stood on the headland with my friend Avery and watched you sail by.
May it please Your Majesty, I accuse this man of piracy and murder!
Was ever a gentleman so misfortunate?
Lock him up in Newgate!
To be held for the next session of the court, there to be tried for his life...
Hands off me, you scum!
All I've done was to the credit and for the honor and glory of England!
So here's me bequest!
To them what hunts what I have hid... and to their sons' sons... Down trough the endless corridors of time... Greed!
That spawns murder.
Hatred!
That corrodes the soul.
Ambition!
The foulest strumpet of all!
Hey Jack!
Jack, hey!
Sell me that hangrope for sixpence, will you!
Save your money me lad!
You can have it all for nothing...
If you'd only step up here and wear it.
Hurry up, Jack!
Can't wait forever!
Captain Kidd is dead, My Lord Blayne.
The account is closed.
By what manner can I atone for the injustice I worked upon your father?
What of you First Sea Lord?
What do you suggest?
We have a fine frigate of fifty guns.
Commissioned for American waters, Sire.
That we sought of naming the 'Lady Anne'.
It shall be a wedding gift to you from the Crown... For your loyalty and service to King and Country.
Moonfleet.
Where do you come from, boy?
Can't you hear?
We asked you a question.
Don't you touch that!
That's my letter!
My mother's letter!
With your permission, young sir.
"My dearest son, John: "I write while I have the strength.
"Make your way to Moonfleet, "and there seek out a gentleman named Jeremy Fox... "who, as I hear, has returned from the colonies "to live in the house which was my home.
"I do not know what the years have done to him.
"But I do knowthat he will be your friend for my sake.
"God bless and keep you both."
It's always a pleasure to see such friendly faces.
Come to the fire, my dear.
My business here will not detain me long.
Greening!
Last night, Master Greening, I dined with lord Ashwood.
The dinner was excellent, but deficient in spirits.
This was the more surprising since I had recently sent his lordship by special messenger four casks of French brandy.
The stuff was delivered.
To whom?
And how much did you take for it, Master Greening?
Maybe I don't choose to say.
And maybe the others don't choose to... A good price, I hope!
For it's the last delivery you'll be making in many a day!
Get out!
Mr. Fox, talking of deliveries, here's one just come.
John Mohune... Olivia's son.
Landlord, look after my guests.
Would you mind if I asked you for proof of some kind?
Not at all, sir.
It's only natural.
What's that?
That's my grandfather's ring.
There's the Mohune crest.
I may as well tell you that I have no affection for the name you bear.
Nor has anyone in these parts.
Moonfleet's had its bellyful of the Mohunes.
Mohune justice, Mohune tyranny, Mohune pride!
Come... Don't let's quarrel on such short acquaintance.
Drink up, John Mohune.
Go on, sit down.
What became of your mother in the great world?
How did she fare when her family fortunes went to smash?
After my father died, she taught school.
And I cleaned out grates and things.
And ran errands.
Did you like that?
The exercise was beneficial.
Why did she send you to me?
Was there no one else?
No one but you, sir.
What am I supposed to do with you?
Make you a pillar of society, like myself?
Thank you, sir.
What do you mean by that?
It's nice to have a friend.
A friend!
You disabuse yourself of that whimsy!
Your mother presumed on a piece of folly that both of us lived to regret!
The Mohunes sawto that.
They married her off to the first available cousin and they shipped me to the devil by the quickest road.
But the devil and I became fast friends.
As everyone in Moonfleet will tell you.
Take him upstairs, put him to bed.
Did they look after you while I was away?
"As the whirlwind passeth, "so is the wicked no more."
Proverbs 10:25.
Come on, before it's dark.
Are you taking me to Mr. Fox?
Is that Mr. Fox's carriage?
You are, aren't you?
Never you mind, sir.
Now, in you get.
I want to go to Mr. Fox!
Well, then, want must be your master.
There we are, sir.
Let me out!
Help!
Boy!
Boy!
Who are you?
Im looking for Mr. Fox.
Do you know where he lives?
He lives in the manor house.
I'll show you.
We're neighbours.
Come on.
Thank you.
You forgot your hat.
Who's that?
A smuggler.
What did he smuggle?
Brandy.
And silk and tobacco.
Why don't his people come in the night and take him down?
Mr. Maskew won't allow it.
Who's Mr. Maskew?.
He's the magistrate.
He says Moonfleet's a nest of smugglers.
He means to make an example out of this one.
He must be a beast!
He's my uncle.
Im sorry.
So am I.
But it can't be helped.
Come along.
That's Mohune Manor in there.
Oh, John, how long will you stay here?
Always.
Stop!
Grace?
Yes, uncle?
Who is that with you?
John Mohune.
He's a friend of Mr. Fox.
Mr. Fox?
Ah, indeed!
Mr. Fox has the most interesting friends.
Give him my compliments.
Mr. Maskew's compliments.
It has long been my wish to get better acquainted with my neighbour Mr. Fox.
And his friends.
Drive on.
Bravo!
Encore!
I want to see Mr. Fox, please.
He's expecting me!
Mr. Fox?
Yes!
Will you let me in, please!
What sort of a man are you?
Here I am, offering you the chance of a lifetime, and I find you absorbed in, er... other things.
You should know, Ashwood, there's a time for business and a time for "other things".
Jeremy... You have a visitor.
It's me, sir.
What the devil!
I beg your pardon, sir.
I didn't knowthere'd be ladies present.
Shall I withdraw, sir?
Not before you've explained yourself.
Sir...
I was kidnapped, sir.
You don't say!
Yes, sir.
What have you done with my coachman?
Overpowered him and left him for dead?
Sir?
It was I who ordered you removed from Moonfleet and sent back North to a school where you'll spend what's left of your boyhood being starved, bullied and beaten into a finished English gentleman.
Is that your decision, sir?
It is.
You wouldn't care to discuss it?
You have views on the subject?
Yes, sir.
Id rather stay here.
The boy's right.
You can't blame him if he likes gay company!
Have a drink, boy!
No, thank you, sir.
Or would you rather dance with that young lady over there?
No, thank you, sir.
I can't dance.
Well, what can you do?
Can you sing?
That's right.
Give us a bawdy song!
If we like it, we'll tell Fox to let you stay.
Hey, how about it, John?
Have you got a song?
I know one, sir.
Well, sing it!
There were two birds sat on a stone One flew away and then there was one The other flew after and then there was none And then the poor stone was left alone Now, sir, do I stay?
Who's to undertake your education?
You, sir.
Don't be selfish, Fox.
If the boy's heart's set on a career of rascality, there's no man in England can set him a better example!
Sir, I object to that remark!
What's that?
You understood me, sir!
Savage little beast!
John!
You will apologise to lord Ashwood.
No, sir!
He insulted you!
They all insulted you!
You're a stubborn, ill-mannered little lad!
Tooley!
Bed this young colt down for the night.
Pack him off to school, the sooner the better.
Drum some manners into him!
Ive changed my mind, Ashwood.
I like him as he is.
And how long is he to stay here?
As long as it amuses me.
What do you intend to do with him?
Corrupt and destroy him too?
There's far more danger of him destroying me.
No!
No!
Help!
Help!
They'll kill me!
Hey, wake up!
They're tearing... Wake up!
Oh, it's you, sir.
Well, did I save your life in the nick of time?
They were tearing at me... the whole pack of them!
Who?
The dogs!
In the summerhouse!
What are you talking about?
My dream!
It was like... Like what?
Something my mother told me.
What did she tell you?
About a friend who came to her one night in the summerhouse.
They set the dogs on him.
They almost tore him to pieces!
Your mother had an overwrought imagination!
She did wrong to fill your head with such nonsense!
Jeremy!
Why do you lie to the boy?
Who was your mother?
Why did she send you to him?
Why?
Answer!
Can't you speak?
It's him they set the dogs on!
They?
Who?
The Mohunes.
Jeremy... Jeremy, why didn't you tell me?
She's dead, Ann.
Not to you, Jeremy!
That's why we had to leave the islands, isn't it?
To come back here to this accursed house...
Her house!
It would have been better for both of us if you'd told me.
So that you could give me the benefit of your compassion?
No, Jeremy, but at least I would have known what lay ahead of me.
I would have known howfoolish I was to be jealous of the others.
The women that you play with to fill the emptiness which is your life!
You're right, Ann.
You should not have come here to share a life that seems so empty.
So I'll arrange for you to return to the islands.
But I have nothing to go back to!
You knowthat!
When I followed you here I gave up everything!
You'll sail on the Bonaventure.
She'll be here within a week.
Mr. Fox!
Mr. Fox!
John!
John!
Ive been here for hours waiting for you.
How did you get in?
I'll show you, if you promise not to tell anybody, or I couldn't come to see you any more.
Here.
There's a breach in the wall.
See?
You do want me to come and see you, don't you?
Well, come on then, we'll sit in the summerhouse.
What's wrong?
What are you afraid of?
You don't talk much, do you?
Did the cat get your tongue?
I can't stay long, you know.
It's almost time for church.
The wind blewthe tide into the graveyard last night.
Came over the wall and right up to the church door.
Washed away some of the tombstones.
Have you ever heard about Redbeard?
Redbeard?
He's been in the churchyard again.
And taken another man.
What?
Master Greening.
They say it was Redbeard that took him!
Do you believe in ghosts?
I believe people should stay out of the graveyard at night.
While Redbeard's around looking for his lost diamond.
If I knew where it was, I wouldn't be afraid!
Id sell the diamond and rebuild the manor.
When my mother lived here, she said the house had a hundred rooms and stables for a hundred horses.
And fountains with gold and silver fish that played all the time.
But it's not yours.
It belongs to Mr. Fox now.
We're going to live here together.
He's my friend!
That's the bell for church.
My uncle's waiting.
Are you coming?
...Praise Him, all creatures here below Praise Him above, ye heavenly host Praise Father, Son and Holy Ghost.
Amenl "Thou shalt not have strange gods before me!"
So it is written.
Yet you worship the dark gods of superstition and falsehood like so many benighted savages!
You whisper of a man long dead, a man whom you call Redbeard!
You credit him with supernatural powers, powers of life and death!
Redbeard, indeed!
Sir John Mohune was an officer of the Crown who betrayed his sacred trust, traduced his king and sold his honour for a diamond of great price!
He died in Hollisbrooke, a madman, balked of the enjoyment of his ill-gotten treasure.
And now, in death, it is not to be believed that such a man would be suffered to defy the divine law and dishonour the resting places of our Christian dead!
Amen!
Amen, Parson.
But if it weren't Redbeard, who killed Cracky Jones last winter?
And now... Nat Greening.
Who took him?
Silence, Granny Clarke, and you, Ratsey, that should know better.
When I urged... that a search be made for Nathaniel Greening, two days missing, I was told that a search was useless, that he was last seen in the churchyard, after sundown, and so must have met a monstrous fate at Redbeard's hands.
I say to you that this is blasphemy!
And I say to you that if you persist in these heathen beliefs, you mock God in His own house and this shall not be forgiven you here or hereafter.
Amen!
Who is it?
It's I, sir.
John Mohune.
Olivia Mohune's boy.
I was fond of your mother.
Most fond.
Seeing you here in church today was a comfort to me.
On a day of great anger!
Parson Glennie, what became of the diamond?
The diamond he sold his honour for.
That secret lies buried with Sir John.
Perhaps it is better so.
But if I found it, it would be mine, wouldn't it?
So young, and your heart already set on possessions?
But if I put it to good use, sir?
If you found it, you would succeed where generations have failed.
Now, my boy, we're about to be plunged in primeval darkness.
You're not afraid to cross the churchyard alone, are you?
No, sir.
Still, you'd better take this.
You can return it in the morning.
I shall look forward to talking with you.
Thank you, sir.
Good night, my boy.
God bless you.
Good night, sir.
Get the ladder up.
Half the roof's fallen in!
Blood, what a shambles!
Get those kegs out of the water!
It was the brandy kegs dancing around, not Redbeard!
I wonder Parson didn't smell a rat!
The tide come any higher, the barrels will float down the aisle!
What about me?
Is this all that's coming?
Parminter's cried off.
And Starkill... Rot their chicken hearts!
What ails 'em?
Feared to showfight since that business of Greening.
The fools!
We'd be twenty against one!
Aye.
But the question is, do we need the one?
Gentlemen!
On my way to Ashwood House, I received a message.
It said that I might find better entertainment here.
Who peached?
I can spare you five minutes.
Well, here it is.
The men's hearts ain't in this business any more.
What do the men want, plainly and simply?
Before they'll run another cargo, they want a bigger share.
It ain't right that some should take all the chances while others pockets all the profits!
You may give yourself airs above ground, Mr. Kiss-me-hand Fox, but down here you're no better than we are.
You witless, gutless misbegotten gallows-bait!
Before you thought yourselves desperate fellows if you smuggled two kegs a month in a load of mackerel!
I turned your paltry swindle into a trade worth thousands!
And I claim the captain's share because I earn it!
Now, gentlemen, anything else you wished to discuss?
No?
Then if you'll excuse me.
"Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees."
Isaiah 35:3.
Im for bed.
Here, best see to this.
Cover it up.
Stap me!
It's not my hat!
It's too small.
Well, it's more'n likely that your head's too big with the brandy.
All right, all right.
Get along with it!
That'll do it.
Now nobody can get in or out!
Mr. Fox!
Mr. Fox!
Carr, Ashwood.
Four queens.
I believe I have the right to a post draw, do I not?
Kings over all!
You're cheating, Ashwood!
Well, even if I were, I should consider it grossly impolite of you to say so in my own house.
Id know you anywhere.
It's Jeremy Fox!
You've got a very good memory, my dear.
Good evening, Mr. Fox.
My lady.
I thought you'd not come.
Ashwood House seems to have so little to attract you.
Not even gypsy music.
I see lord Ashwood keeps you well informed.
Jamie has no secrets from me.
Nor you from him?
Why do you smile?
Women.
They have a way of combining passion with foresight, the joys of the moment with a providential care of the future.
Ive a right to think of my future.
Especially now that you're a part of it.
Now, that's an honour I hardly deserve.
There's no man in England who deserves it less.
I think you're cynical and ruthless, almost certainly cruel, a man of bad character and evil reputation.
You're quite right, my lady.
But then Ive never believed in the attraction of opposites.
I think there's a far more powerful affinity between equals.
Help!
Help!
Wake up!
Let me in!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Granny Tucker, are ye daft, woman?
He's back!
I heard 'im pipin'!
A-cryin' and a-wailin' like a soul in pain.
Get home before I slit your gizzard, you old bag o' bones!
Tell Parson Redbeard's abroad!
Lyin' in wait to throttle us all!
Like Cracky Jones and Greening!
Mr. Fox!
Help!
Help!
Mr. Fox!
Mr. Fox!
Help!
Help!
Mr. Fox!
I'm glad there's no truth in the rumour I heard.
Rumours?
That you'd renounced the pleasures of bachelorhood for the sake of an adopted son.
My lady, if I wanted a son, do you really think I'd have no other choice but to adopt one?
Well, with no ties in this country, you're free to travel.
Aren't you?
But I have no such intention.
You will change your mind after speaking to Jamie.
We're going abroad!
And you're coming with us.
As Jamie's partner.
You're not averse to being my partner, are you, Fox?
Her ladyship was just hinting at the advantages that such an arrangement might hold for me.
Was she?
I have three ships outfitting at Rotterdam.
They're being armed to conduct operations of war against the merchant fleets of certain hostile nations.
Piracy.
That shouldn't bother a man like you, Fox.
A man with brains, courage and capital.
Capital?
Equal shares.
And a fortune to be made.
Equal shares.
If you accept, we'll take you with us to Rotterdam.
You mean that her ladyship would be coming with us?
You don't think that I'd start a newventure without lady Ashwood's moral support, do you?
Well, Fox?
Now, why do you hesitate?
All partnerships have two things in common: the partner who cheats and the partner who is cheated.
My dear Fox, you knowthat I trust you completely in every respect.
And surely you don't think that I would cheat you?
Milord, a message by hand for Mr. Fox.
Excuse me.
My lady...
Going, Fox?
I'm afraid I must.
At this hour?
You make it sound a matter of life and death.
Is it, my lady.
It seems that the offer was not as attractive as you thought.
It was your offer he refused, Jamie.
Not mine.
I don't fancy killin' the boy.
There's no sense in puttin' off what's got to be done!
I say to wait.
I ain't goin' to get in no trouble with Mr. Fox.
Look, I'm through with waitin' on Mr. Fox!
What's to be done with the boy?
A little boat ride... A little splash, and it's all over as prim as you please.
Take him down to the wharf.
Out the back with him now.
Let's get through with it.
He's sneakin' out!
Help me!
Open up!
Open up in the King's name!
There are men at every door!
Elzevir Block!
Captain Hawkins, present your warrant.
Authority to search the premises.
Objections?
No.
I thought not.
Your keys!
Well, whom have we here?
Mr. Fox's young friend.
You astonish me, Master Mohune.
This is not fit company for a gentleman.
Mister... Master John is so kind as to make allowances.
He sees through our rough ways into our kind hearts.
Don't you, Master John?
Master John has remarkable eyesight!
"Unto the pure, all things are pure."
Titus... Mister... Well?
Master John was about to... Let Master John speak for himself.
Come here, boy.
Please, sir, they're going to take me away on a boat and... Maskew!
I can scarcely believe my eyes!
A King's magistrate carousing in a fisherman's pothouse?
Why not, Mr. Fox?
Am I not in good company?
Am I not in some sort a fisherman myself?
Don't I spread my nets to catch all kinds of fish, both great and small?
Did you know a man named Greening, Mr. Fox?
I never had that pleasure.
His mother believes him to have been engaged in the smuggling trade.
Suspects he met foul play at the hands of his companions.
Well then, your course is clear.
Hang the lot.
Never fear, Mr. Fox.
In due course and with proper evidence, I will have every smuggling rascal in this parish swing and sun-dry.
I hope I'm there to see it.
Oh, you will be, Mr. Fox.
At my personal invitation.
Until then... One moment!
Master John, you were going to tell me something.
Well, come on.
You said they were going to... yes, going to take you out on a boat and... Go on, please.
Speak up, boy.
That's all, sir.
Well?
Nothing out of the way, sir.
Oh, cheer up, Maskew.
You can't hope to hang a man every morning.
That was a near thing.
Why didn't he speak?
He could have saved himself.
He has saved himself.
It won't do, Mr. Fox.
That boy knows enough to hang all of us.
The boy is my responsibility.
I'll dispose of him in my own way.
After what he's heard and seen in the vault, he can't live!
I'll take that risk.
Well, we won't!
This is the second time that you've chosen to speak for these men.
I take it you regard yourself as their leader.
Well, Master Block, we'll settle that now.
Get out of the way!
Now, Master Block... does he live or die?
Live!
Are you all right, sir?
The exercise was beneficial.
The Bonaventure will be in before dawn with a cargo of silk and brandy.
You'll get your orders.
Be on the beach, and ready!
Come on, John Mohune.
My locket, please.
Here you are, Master John.
You opened it and stole what was in it!
Young sir, what use could I have for a set of Bible verses I know by heart?
Bible verses!
John!
All very edifying, complete to the last syllable, chapter and verse.
But every blessed number written down wrong!
Makes no sense at all.
None that my poor head can grasp.
No, John.
We won't discuss it further.
Please, sir.
I swear I won't tell.
I'm sorry, John, but under the circumstances, I have no choice but to send you to the colonies, where I trust you will live long and die rich.
You sail tonight.
Go to your room, John.
Yes, sir.
You heard what I said to the boy?
You're sending him away?
Yes.
I wish he'd never come, Jeremy.
So do I.
Do you, Jeremy?
The Bonaventure will be in tonight.
The carriage will take you down to the beach, you and the boy.
When we've unloaded her cargo, you'll go aboard.
At St Helier, you will be put on a Dutch ship for the islands.
Here, you'd better take this.
You'll need it.
Goodbye, John Mohune.
Jeremy!
It's no use.
They're everywhere.
They have orders to kill you.
Isn't that why you sent them down on us?
The boat!
Our only chance, Jeremy!
You're wrong, Ann!
There's Jeremy Fox!
Don't let him get away!
Surrender, Fox, or I'll shoot you down.
Let me do it, sir.
I'm quite good at that.
No!
And stop looking at me with those spaniel eyes!
Since you appeared, I've had nothing but trouble!
You saved my life, sir.
That doesn't mean you should follow me like a lost dog!
Will nothing teach you once and for all that I will not be bound by responsibilities and debts and ties and obligations?
I wish to heaven your mother had never sent you to me!
Now, there's the road.
You go that way, back to Moonfleet.
They're looking for a man with a boy.
You'd be my death warrant.
Here, sir.
Take this.
What is it?
The money you gave me on the beach.
You'll be needing it.
You keep it.
Don't worry about me, sir.
I'll sell the locket from Redbeard's coffin.
It's silver.
I was hoping to find the diamond in it.
You didn't, huh?
No.
Just a paper with Bible verses.
And all of them numbered wrong.
At least that's what Master Ratsey said.
Bible verses?
In Redbeard's coffin?
Let me look at that!
You say all these numbers are wrong?
That's what Master Ratsey said.
Jeremiah 51:10... One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten: "Treasure"!
The tenth word is treasure!
Treasure?
"Lo, I am this day fourscore and five years old."
Six.
One, two, three, four, five, six: "Fourscore".
I does mean something, doesn't it, sir?
It's a cipher!
Fourscore... feet... deep.
"Well".
In a well!
Hollisbrooke is the deepest well in England!
And your Redbeard, Master John Mohune, was governor of Hollisbrooke Castle!
Then that's where the diamond is!
If there is a diamond.
Oh, there is, sir!
I know it!
It's in that well!
Fourscore deep... Sir, is there a way to get down that far?
Yes, there's a way.
You're late, my lord.
If your messenger hadn't been so... persuasive, I shouldn't have come at all.
Hauling me out of bed at three o'clock in the morning!
How kind, calling me a gentleman.
A drink?
I don't drink with hunted felons.
Not drink to our partnership?
We have no partnership.
You're mistaken, Ashwood.
Ive decided to accept your offer.
My dear Fox, well, to put it bluntly, you no longer have the necessary qualifications.
In your own words: brains, courage... And the capital.
And capital.
Im about to come into an unexpected inheritance.
Congratulations!
But aren't you selling the bear's skin before the bear is killed?
Give me time to kill him.
Sorry, but we leave for Rotterdam tomorrow night.
Till tomorrow night then.
Ten o'clock.
Stop your coach at the bend on the North Cove Road.
If I satisfy you that Im a partner worth having, then you'll take me with you.
And if you fail to satisfy?
Well, there's a hundred guineas consolation.
Very well.
You're not thinking of taking that boy along, are you?
I may be able to save you from the gallows, but not with that brat hanging onto your coattails!
You knowthat, don't you?
Yes.
You'll have to get rid of him.
Yes!
Shall I convey your respects to lady Ashwood?
Tell her that Im looking forward to our partnership.
Come off it, major.
You go on duty at eight!
Hey, hey, Hennishaw, where are you going?
That's not the way to Hollisbrooke!
Blasted Hollisbrooke!
Blasted army!
Must go.
Duty at eight.
Of course, major, of course.
But there's always time for a little nap, isn't there, major?
Time?
Of course there's time.
Hennishaw'll have a head in the morning.
Is the candle all ready?
The cord measured out?
Sir!
Now you look here, this isn't a game, so let's understand each other.
If anything goes wrong, it'll be each for himself.
If I have to abandon you, Ill do so without hesitation.
I don't think you'd do that, sir.
You're very much mistaken.
If you'd been my son...
Yes, sir?
Id have taught you to trust no one!
But you are my friend!
I am your partner.
In a dangerous venture!
Clear?
The exercise will be beneficial.
Hey, coachman!
Wait for me over there.
Hey, boy!
Come here!
Me, sir?
You want to earn a copper?
Yes, sir.
Well, you carry these and follow me.
Major!
What?
A sentry leaving his post!
The countersign... Is this one of His Majesty's military prisons or a country fair?
But my orders are...
Your orders are to stay on guard.
And what's that bird's nest you've got on your back... a uniform?
Who's your officer?
Lt Upjohn, sir.
My compliments to him.
If ever I have occasion to inspect his guard, I shall hope to see British soldiers that look like British soldiers!
Dismissed!
Sir!
You ready?
Yes, sir.
Come on, in you get.
Anything wrong here, major?
Who are you?
The well-tender.
The well-tender, eh?
And you ask me if there's anything wrong!
Haven't you been selling water to the prisoners?
Why, sir, it's not so.
I...
Selling them water and hiding your takings in this well?
May I be struck dead, sir, if Id do a thing like that!
Yes, if I were you, I would not tempt Providence.
Mr. Fox!
Mr. Fox!
Who's that?
Well, what's he doing down there?
Proving your innocence... if you are innocent!
Boy!
Yes, major?
Proceed with the search.
Yes, sir.
All right, lower away.
Stop!
Stop it!
Ive found it, sir!
Found what?
Raise it.
Got a memento of the wars, I see there, major.
Well, no more than anyone else who served in France.
I don't know where you got that one, friend, but it weren't in the wars.
The 10th Light Infantry is a garrison regiment.
It's stationed at Hollisbrooke these six years.
Let go of that brake.
That's an order!
That game's played out!
Now, come on!
Give us what you found, or down you go!
Let's have it!
Quick!
You go on ahead.
Lt Upjohn, sir.
I have the honour to present the guard for inspection.
Loose.
Give the countersign!
Countersign be hanged!
Im major Hennishaw, you idiot!
Well, my compliments, lieutenant.
Stop that man!
Stop him, I say!
He's a thief and an impostor!
That boy!
They were together!
Stop him!
Stop him!
Stop him!
I thought you'd gone.
Gone where?
To the beach.
To look at the boat.
It's still there.
Yes.
It's still there.
This time tomorrow, we'll be across the channel and safe, won't we?
I knew you wouldn't do it.
Do what?
You said you'd leave me.
But you didn't.
Go back to sleep.
My mother worried that Id always be poor.
Now we're rich.
I think she'd have liked us to live together in the manor, don't you?
Yes.
Now we'll never go back there.
You may...
I shan't.
Then I shan't either.
In the colonies, when we sell the diamond... we could have a house like my mother's, couldn't we?
With stables for a hundred horses, and fountains...
Delighted to see you, my dear Fox.
My lady.
Clarissa.
He must call me that, mustn't he, Jamie?
Nowthat we're partners.
The question is, are we partners?
You won't think me unmannerly if I ask to see some evidence of your good fortune?
Ive never seen anything so... so...
It must be worth at least... My body and soul, sir!
This is the most remarkable... Fox, I congratulate you.
Satisfied?
Drive on!
To you, sir!
And to our future!
By heaven, Fox, I grudge the years that we've spent apart.
We belong together, the two of us.
The three of us!
The four of us.
You've forgotten the diamond.
Where did you find it, Jeremy?
Or shouldn't I ask?
An heirloom, my dear.
Our friend has come into an unexpected inheritance.
Well, he doesn't seem to be enjoying it as he should.
Oh, your poor hand!
As soon as we get on board, you'll let me take care of it, won't you?
Did you know, Fox, they're offering 300 guineas for you now?.
Your value's tripled, alive or dead.
He's becoming more precious every moment.
Halt!
In the King's name!
Pull up your horses!
Let's have a look at your passengers.
What the deviIs going on here?
Name, sir?
Destination?
Destination Poole.
As to my name...
I was under the impression that this crest was not entirely unknown in these parts.
Oh, I beg your pardon, my lord.
We're looking for a criminal by the name of Fox and a boy... Well, it's hardly likely that they'd be travelling with me!
No, my lord, of course not, not likely at all.
Begging your lordship's pardon, I have my orders.
All vehicles must be searched.
Father!
Doesn't the lieutenant know that we have better things to do than to spend the night here, chatting with him?
Your son-in-law, my lord?
Honeymoon.
My best wishes.
There'll be no further delay in your journey.
Well, good hunting.
I hope you get your birds.
We will, my lord, alive or dead, we'll get them.
Very resourceful, my dear.
You saved our friend's life.
That's almost worth a diamond, isn't it?
Is it?
Good thing the boy wasn't with us.
He'd have stumped even you, eh, Clarissa?
Or perhaps you would've had me claim him as my grandson.
By the way, what did you do with him?
Kill him to be rid of him?
You approve?
Children are such a pest!
I can't see how anybody would want to be bothered with one.
Vicious little chap!
Spilt a glass of wine all over me!
Flew at me because I called you a scoundrel!
Remember?
An absolute tiger!
I remember.
I wish you'd look a little happier, Fox.
Personally, Im delighted.
Especially with myself!
You've every reason to be.
Think of it!
In less than an hour we'll be on board ship, headed for a new life of ease and splendour.
I doubt the world holds more fortunate beings than ourselves.
Stop!
Coachman, pull up!
What's that?
We're going back.
Turn the coach around.
You're mad, Fox!
Im not going back!
Well, this coach is, with or without you.
Now, you take the road down to the beach.
If anyone tries to stop you, drive straight on.
Come on, do what I tell you!
Jeremy!
John!
Time to go, sir?
No, no yet.
Is anything the matter?
No, no.
Our plans have changed.
You stay here till dawn.
Then you're to make your way back to Moonfleet.
Go to Parson Glennie.
Give him the diamond and tell him everything.
Aren't we leaving together?
If anybody stops you, say that I was holding you and you escaped.
But sir, I don't want to go without you!
We can't always do what we want, John.
I need someone here at home I can trust, someone I can rely on till I get back.
But you'll be back soon?
As soon as I can.
Can I depend on you?
Yes, sir, if you think it's best.
It's best.
Good luck, John Mohune.
Good luck, sir.
It's the first time these gates have stood open for a dozen years.
They must be open!
There's no telling when he'll come home.
Jeremy Fox?
You're sure he'll come back?
He's my friend.
Now I am the richest person in the world.
I am the richest person in the world.
Now I am the richest person in the world.
I am the richest person in the world.
I am... Mi capitn, not another ship in sight.
Yes, King Carlos should be very pleased.
Tell me, who is more important to please... the King of Spain or God?
Well, God, of course.
And who is God's personal representative in this vicinity?
Well, you are, Your Blessed Rectitude.
Well, God wants to keep all of it.
But... And anybody who dares "buts" God's personal representative... will soon find his head pierced and his neck stretched... and will go on to meet God very quickly!
Which is more than anybody could reasonably hope for...
Your Holy Ruthlessness.
Instead, you may bang your head on the floor until forgiven.
Congratulations, Captain Yellowbeard.
I'm glad my plan was a success.
Your plan, my gold.
Hands off my treasure, Bosun Moon!
I said hands off!
Do I have to do everything myself?
Come now, don't slow down.
Step over him.
Move it.
Step out of the way.
We've got another one here now.
Over here.
Bloody hell, another one.
Bloody witches.
Corpses, corpses, all day long.
Never stops.
You know, Gilbert, being a prisoner's not what it was when I came in here.
Here we go.
Whimpering poncies.
They get a leg broken and they faint.
A few fingernails pulled out, they start crying.
When they stretched me on a rack for a couple of years...
I didn't go around dying all over the place.
Pathetic.
Taking the easy way out like that.
How do you mean exactly?
Dying.
He'd only been in 15 years.
You won't catch me dying.
They'll have to kill me before I die.
Many a man has tried, Captain Yellowbeard.
And soon you will be at large again.
With a hand-picked crew of the hardest buccaneers... that have ever stained the seven seas with Spanish blood.
It was most unjust I thought, locking you up for... merely doing your duty.
Twenty years for killing 5,000 dagos and frogs.
Betrayed by me right-hand man, that bastard Moon.
But he never found out where you hid the treasure, did he?
No!
Nor will he ever.
Where did you hide the treasure, actually?
You won't catch me with those trick questions.
What really pisses me off, is... What is it now?
You've got a visitor.
I expect that'll be the Queen with my pardon.
Hello, sugar drawers.
What, you again?
Again?
I haven't seen you for 15 years.
What is it this time?
Well, what with you being let out next week...
I thought it was my duty as a wife to bring you up to date on a few things.
Now, do you remember just before you were arrested we were having a cuddle?
I was raping you, if that's what you mean.
All right.
Sort of half cuddle, half rape.
Get on with it, woman!
Well, I haven't told you this before, because I wanted him to be brought up... like a gentleman and not a pirate.
Who are you talking about?
The fruit of your loins, sugar drawers.
Are you mad, woman?
I haven't got fruit in my loins.
Lice, yes, and proud of them!
It means that we have spawned a son.
Done what?
You have just become the father... of a 20-year-old bouncing boy called Dan.
A son.
Takes after me, does he?
Well... By the time I was 20, I'd killed 500 men.
Well, he's not quite so extroverted as you, but he's... A thief?
No.
A rapist?
No.
Bloody hell.
I give up.
What is he then?
He's a gardener.
A gardener?
A Yellowbeard gardening?
I'll see about that when I'm out.
What is it now?
Time's up, sir.
So your son's a gardener, eh?
There you are, Mr. Pew.
I said a double.
Did you?
I know a double when I hears one.
When!
Dan's coming.
Reading as usual.
There you are, Dan.
Got a moment?
I'm reading something.
Read, read.
Read, read, read.
There's more important things in life than reading, Son.
Keep an ear on the bar, would you, Mr. Pew?
Right.
If there's one thing I've learned in life... it's that learning things never taught me nothing.
And books is the worst.
All right, Mother.
Last time I read a book, I was raped.
So let that be a lesson to you.
What do you want?
Well, it's about your father.
What about him?
Well, when I said he was dead...
I was only trying to cushion the blow.
What blow?
He's alive.
He's alive and imprisoned as a pirate.
A pirate?
Like Yellowbeard?
Very much like Yellowbeard, yes.
In fact, he is Yellowbeard.
No, thank you, sir.
Commander Clement, Royal Navy.
Welcome, Commander Clement.
Her Majesty's temporary throne room... is in the huge withdrawing room.
Thank you, Lady Lambourn.
Lambourn, stop that man pissing on the hedge.
It's imported!
You, come here!
You, stop that at once!
That comes special, all the way from Egypt!
Next... the head of Her Majesty's Secret Service.
Not to be read out loud.
Excuse me.
Joking apart.
Royal Navy Commander Clement.
The fat one on the throne is the Queen.
She's not very well today, so I should kneel upwind of her.
And the thin one is Lady Churchill.
She's the brains of the outfit.
State your business.
Your Majesty, we in the Naval Department... while being keenly aware of recent spirals in Defense expenditure... humbly submit... Are you the Prime Minister?
Secret Service.
Charades!
You're a beekeeper.
That'll do for her.
Will it?
What do you want?
The pirate Yellowbeard is due to be released in two days... and despite years of unpleasantness, he's still told us nothing... of the treasure he's hidden.
However, I have a detailed plan here.
I doubt if she could manage more than the label on a gin bottle.
Just tell us.
Well, milady, we'd like you to increase his sentence, so he's bound to escape... and make straight for the treasure.
I shall need a fast ship to follow him.
A sensible request, I think, Your Majesty.
The beekeeper would like this signed.
Certainly.
Come on, move it, you ratbag!
Get in there!
Mr. Yellowbeard.
Captain to you, you scum.
Quite.
Sorry, "Captain" Yellowbeard.
Yes.
Twenty years ago today, you were sentenced to jail.
Yes, and now I'm due to be released.
Yes.
Or rather no.
You see, 20 years ago... no one was expected to live in jail for 20 years.
Filthy, horrendous conditions that existed then, and, indeed... still exist today.
So the judge who sentenced you had no idea you would survive.
Therefore, Her Majesty has graciously agreed... to increase your sentence a further 140 years.
Case dismissed.
I've got him!
Sorry.
Get off of me!
What are you doing?
Stop him!
Stop him!
Get over there where you belong!
Went well with the Commander then, did it?
No.
So I can take it you won't be leaving us just yet, as it were.
They broke their solemn word.
There's governments for you.
I expect they wanted to know about the treasure.
Yes, and that's something they'll never know.
Well, until you tell them about the treasure... the only way you're gonna get out of here is feet first.
Open the gate!
Must be an awful strain... being the only man in the world knowing where it's hidden.
Why don't you share the burden with a friend?
Gilbert.
Mr.
Moon?
Is that you?
Get a move on, Gilbert.
Coming, Captain.
Here I come.
Move, you scum.
Yellowbeard.
Who was that stink?
I do wish it didn't have to be such a rush every time.
What?
I haven't got time for that now!
Well, it's been 20 years since we had a little cuddle... and what do you do?
Come in here and give me a kiss?
No.
You rush in and hack a hole in the wall.
Where's the map?
What map?
If you say you don't know where it is...
I'll nail your tits to the table!
Oh, dear!
I know where it is.
It's burnt.
You burnt my map?
But only after I copied it.
Where's the copy?
When little Dan came along... Who's Dan?
My and probably your son!
When little Dan was two minutes old...
I tattooed it on his head.
Does he know about this?
No.
Nor nobody else, neither.
That's why I kept him in the cupboard for three years.
That may be why he's a bit odd... with all these books and reading and stuff like that.
Where is he now?
Lambourn Hall.
Right.
I'll go up there and cut his head off.
Where's my pirating outfit?
Royal Navy here.
Where's Yellowbeard?
Yellowbeard!
Where is Yellowbeard?
He's...
He's...
He's...
He's...
He's... gone!
Gone!
Well... if he's gone, you must have seen him.
No.
Who's the pretty boy?
Shut up!
And what's this?
That's Lord Lambourn's waistcoat.
He's such a kind man.
He thinks of everybody.
He left those here in case you escaped... and needed a change of clothing.
I'm sure I killed the last one I raped.
It can't have been you.
The after-play was a bit on the rough side... but not fatal, dear.
What's this Dan, or whatever you call him, look like?
He looks a little bit like Lord Lambourn, actually.
But a bit more like you.
Much more like you, in fact.
Yellowbeard.
A tall, rough man with a big yellow beard.
That's our agent, sir.
Did you see...
He's blind, you stupid sod!
I may be blind... but I have acute hearing.
I'm not interested in your jewelry, cloth eyes.
I'm trying to conduct... Yellowbeard... was here.
How do you know it was him?
Because he sounded... about 47... and his clothing gave off the unmistakable fibrous crackling sound... of the 80% hessian...
Which way did he go?
...whilst the deafening rustling of his beard... indicated a length of not...
Which way did he go?
Upstairs.
Come on!
Where's Yellowbeard?
He's in prison, isn't he?
Your husband escaped this evening.
We know he came straight here.
Come to think of it, somebody did come in here a while back... but I don't think it was my husband.
These are his clothes.
Wait a minute.
Somebody did pop in and rape me.
These must be his clothes.
That's Yellowbeard, all right.
Prison has reformed him.
He never bothered to take his clothes off in the old days.
Where did he go?
I've no idea.
Right, Mansell.
Bring those clothes.
We'll need a scent.
For the dogs.
Right.
Yellowbeard?
Evening, Gilbert.
Now look here, Pew.
I'm all ears.
Those two gentlemen that just left... you didn't tell them everything you heard, did you, shipmate?
What gentlemen?
I didn't hear you mention much about a map.
What map?
Yellowbeard's map.
The one that any pirate worth his parrot would give both his wooden legs for.
You're drunk, Gilbert.
Your mind's wandering.
My hands will be wandering towards your throat, Pew... if you don't tell me what it is you overheard.
So you can pass the information on to Mr.
Moon... so he can find the treasure?
Over my dead body.
Very well, if those are your conditions.
I was hoping we might see this eye to eye.
I'm afraid you've forced my hand.
Listen up, my hearties!
Listen.
This dear old blind man here... is a government agent!
It is true.
I saw him talking to those two.
It is a lie!
I only told him one thing... about a treasure!
Treasure?
Bolt that door.
Bolt that door, lads.
Draw them curtains.
Draw them curtains!
Put them other lights out.
Put them other lights out, lads!
Where's Yellowbeard?
Mr.
Moon, sir.
I was following him, and then I thought I was being followed... if you follow me.
Who'd follow you?
Some stupid blind man.
Well, we've got to follow Yellowbeard, and make sure no one else is following him.
Do you follow me?
What's going on in there?
Evening.
Sounded as though there was a bit of a squabble.
Squabble?
They're all dead.
AII?
Must have been more of a tiff then.
Squabble, tiff.
Mr.
Moon!
I imagine being in the Navy, you must know quite a lot about the sea and what's in it.
A trifle.
A trifle?
Yes, I once had a rum trifle, but I only drink when I'm working.
Indeed.
There you are, Lambourn.
I was wanting your advice on a matter of etiquetty.
Now, does one curtsey before saying adieu... or does one go down while speaking?
Oh, dear.
That's tricky.
Excuse me, Admiral.
I must just have a word with this gentleman.
I shan't be a moment.
Oh, I say.
Who was that chap who just seized hold of my wife?
Do you know him?
Steady.
Steady.
He seems to have taken quite a shine to Lady L. Yes.
Not many people do, you know.
But when they do, they do.
And when she does, she does.
Is your name Dan?
Yes.
I need your head, my lad.
You're my father.
So your mother says, but that's no reason to believe it.
Never trust a woman or a government.
Well, pleased to meet you.
I haven't got time for idle chitchat!
I need your head.
Well, that makes a change.
Mother seems to disapprove of me using it at all.
You're not gonna use it.
You're gonna lose it, lad.
I'm gonna use it.
Right.
Put your neck over there.
It'll be cleaner that way.
You want to cut my head off?
What for?
I don't want to lug your body... halfway around the world, do I?
Your head's got a map on it that I need.
Well, you don't need to kill me for it.
Look, why don't you copy it?
What?
And have two maps?
Bugger off!
Look, if you cut my head off, it'll start to putrefy.
Do what?
Putrefy!
Go rotten!
Yeah, it would ooze a lot.
Heads do.
But I can live with that.
No, stop!
Look!
I could help you, Dad.
Everyone will be following you... and if they catch you, they'll have the map.
Bugger them!
I'll eat it first.
Won't be the first head I've eaten.
But then you'll have lost it forever.
Look.
Wouldn't it be better to leave it where it's safe?
What?
And take you along?
You're not pirate material!
You wouldn't fit in.
Hello, Dan.
Been doing some gardening?
I don't believe we've been introduced.
All right, Dan.
If you're my son, prove it.
Kill this stupid old bugger.
Now hold your horses.
I can't kill him.
He brought me up... just like a father.
You mean he's beaten you and kicked you and smashed you in the teeth?
Yes.
No!
No.
He's been kind and gentle.
What kind of father is that?
Kill him!
No!
All right.
I'll do it.
No, don't!
Look, he could be useful.
Yes, I could be useful.
I could, I could, I could.
What could I do?
They followed you here.
I'll kill them all!
No, quick hide in here.
All right.
But I'll kill anyone that gets in the way of me killing anyone.
We'll take him to Dr. Gilpin's.
He always knows what to do.
And then kill everybody!
Whatever you like, Dad.
Dad?
Him?
You mean to say I'm not your father?
No.
Mother says he is, but you're still my father to me.
I'm still my father to you, Son.
Look, you brought me up.
You're my father.
I don't even know him.
Lambourn!
I'll come with you, Son.
This Dr. Gilpin, is he your father?
No, he's your closest friend.
I look forward to meeting him.
Twenty-three, twenty-four, twenty-five... Lady Lambourn.
Well, he's not even married to her.
I think he's blind.
Under her command, so to speak.
Now, see here, if you go with him, you'll be criminals.
You'll never be able to return to England.
But if the government gets the treasure... they'll only waste it.
Warmongering in Europe.
There we are.
That looks nothing like me!
Well, that's the whole idea.
I've got to go with him, my father, to get the treasure.
I've got the map of the island.
Could be very dangerous.
It'll be dangerous.
Do the boy good... to get a bit of senseless violence into his life.
Will you come with us, too, Doctor?
Why, think of all the new plants and medicines you could discover.
Yeah.
What's this?
Stop!
That's a precious extract from a rare tropical tree.
One drop of it paralyzes a man instantly.
Perhaps it wears off instantly.
No.
No.
Possibly ineffective when taken through the mouth.
Well, of course, if we really were... going on a botanical expedition...
They're here.
Kill!
There's no need to.
We must find a name for you.
Professor...
Professor Flask.
Professor Death!
Professor Chair.
Professor Rape!
Professor Clock.
What about Professor Anthrax?
Yes.
Anthrax.
Bugger off, you evil git!
Evening, Doctor.
I was just saying good day to Mr. Pew.
Lord Lambourn.
And Dan.
And?
Yeah, this is Professor Anthrax.
That's Yellowbeard.
I'm in disguise, you stupid tart!
You've met your father then.
Yes.
We've got some exciting news.
You're all going after the treasure!
Treasure?
No.
No.
Botanical...
Killing plants!
Chasing butterflies.
No.
Well, I'm entitled to my share.
What with all the lying and cheating and tattooing that I've done over the years.
Don't worry, Mother.
You'll get your share.
I don't ask for much.
I'd just like to see a few of my little dreams come true.
I've always wanted to buy Denmark and be richer than the Queen.
Yes, and if you do your job covering up for us, Mother... that will all come true.
And by the way... why did you tell me that I was his father?
I didn't.
You were so sure he was, I didn't have the heart to tell you.
I think... we'd better sail for Jamaica at once.
We'll find a ship... at Portsmouth.
I was only taking what's my due to cover expenses.
You should see the mess they made.
What happened?
Plague.
Plague?
All sudden like.
Lucky I was out.
That man's got a sword in him.
He fell on it.
Has Yellowbeard been here?
He's dead, too.
And Lord Lambourn and Dr. Gilpin.
And my son.
My son, Dan!
All gone, all dead.
Oh, my!
Oh, hell.
If they're all dead, what are you gonna tell the Queen, sir?
I mean, we're supposed to follow them to the treasure.
Halt!
In the name of the law!
All right!
I'm not deaf!
All right, Pew, what have you heard?
Little did Yellowbeard surmise... as he presented himself to his prospective traveling companions... that the details of the engagements were being overheard... by a tall blind man of impressive bearing... aquiline features... Cut the purple prose, Pew.
Just give us the facts.
Where's Yellowbeard gone?
Portsmouth.
With whom?
Three people.
Lambourn.
Dan.
Dr. Gilpin.
Right, Mansell.
We shall be needing that frigate.
Come on, Mansell.
We'll be needing Mrs.
Beard.
I think a month or two at sea will loosen Mrs.
Beard's tongue.
Is she going away, too, sir?
That'll do him.
How's that for a squabble, Pew?
Here!
Stop!
Thief!
Fresh flowers!
Get your lucky heather!
Yoo-hoo, fresh flowers, sir?
Yes.
Fresh heather!
Fresh flowers!
I've always been fascinated by the sea.
It's so big.
It has the little...
It's the mouth of the river port, isn't it?
Oh, my God!
Come on.
Harden your knives here.
Sharpen your knives.
Can I have three farthings for a lump of shit, please?
I beg your pardon?
I said can I have three farthings for a lump of shit?
No.
Society's to blame.
Harden your knives here.
Sharpen your knives.
Excuse me a moment.
Look out!
Press gang!
Get out!
Press gang.
Get him.
Come on.
Catch him over there.
Come on, get him!
That's the stuff.
Press gang?
Yes, they persuade drunks and vagrants to become sailors.
What happens when they sober up?
They're at sea.
Okay, get that one in there!
Shove him in good, please.
All right, good.
He was a bit thin.
Those ones over there, they look good.
I say.
I'll give you three farthings, young lady.
There we are.
Oopsy daisy.
A good big one will always beat a rotten little one.
What's going on, hey?
What do you think you're doing?
Just borrowing your jacket, Bosun.
I say, sir.
I just saw two naval gentlemen going the other way.
Where's Yellowbeard?
Professor Anthrax.
He can't be far.
He'll find us.
He needs that map.
Well, I hope he finds us before they find him.
And it's not long before we sail.
Now, we know it's an island close to Jamaica, and we've got the map of it.
But without him to tell us which island, we might as well go home.
Now, I'm sure some of you gentlemen would like to volunteer... for a well-paid, well-fed adventure holiday... such as youths dream of... upon a modern, rat-free, leak-proof ship!
Any volunteers just lie down on the ground with your eyes shut.
Would you gentlemen be looking for a ship?
We... Well, as a matter of fact... we're lucky enough already to have tickets for the... Load them on.
Take them to the ship.
Come on, kick him out!
Come on!
Oh, my God!
He's thrown her in the water tub!
Take your hands off of me!
Shut up and move!
I want these three shackled in the bilges.
Move over!
Come on, old man.
There's no need.
We can make our own way there.
Sign here.
I'll make your mark.
There's your shilling.
Thank you, sir!
Don't do that.
Don't do that ever again.
Get off, lad.
All right.
Come on, move it.
I never noticed that hook when he signed on.
Nor did I, sir.
He's right-handed, sir.
Get rid of the others.
Quiet!
Mr.
Crisp.
Aye, sir!
What is that?
That's my box, sir.
No, carrying your box.
Cabin boy Smith, sir.
Smith has tits.
He's been a bit ill, sir.
Get her off!
Aye, sir.
Wait a minute.
What is that?
It's a crocodile, sir.
What's it for?
Well, each sailor is... allowed, by tradition, a pet, sir.
One pet per sailor, parrots preferred.
Well, we like clubbed together, as it were, if you take my drift, sir.
That's bigger than three parrots.
Not if they're in cages, sir.
Open it up.
Open it up?
Open it up!
There are buttons down the side.
The ancient superstition that a woman onboard brings bad luck... is now a proven scientific fact.
Nice try, Rosie.
Shouldn't bother, love.
They're fairly strict on this one.
Rattus vulgaris.
Yeah.
You know, I've been thinking.
If we paid 300 guineas each for this cabin...
I'm glad we didn't go for the cheaper ones.
I'm sorry to interrupt your morning bath, gentlemen.
On your knees!
And crawl up here on the double!
Up here on the double!
All hands present, Mr.
Crisp, sir!
Thank you, Bosun!
Deliver me, O Lord, from the evil man, preserve me from the violent man... My name is Captain Hughes.
These are my officers, Lieutenant Martin, who is responsible for discipline...
Lieutenant Crisp, who is responsible for discipline... Mr. Prostitute, who is responsible for... Nail that man's foot to the deck.
Aye, sir.
Discipline.
No, I...
It's all right.
No.
I was just joking.
I was just having a...
Here, hang on.
Hey, wait a minute.
Now, in fairness to all of you...
I'm honor bound to ask this question.
Is there anyone here who does not wish to be a member of Her Majesty's Navy?
Me, sir.
Is there anyone else who is reluctant to serve?
Right.
If, by chance, some of you may feel that the discipline on this ship... is a trifle on the harsh side of strict... let me remind you that it is our duty to seek out and destroy...
Her Majesty's enemies... the foul... and most foreign French.
Here, here.
Now... while the rest of the world will eventually arrive at the same conclusion... it is our urgent task... to push things on a little.
Amen.
Next.
Mr. Martin, Mr. Prostitute... luncheon duty.
Right, Mr. Beamish, I'll see the prisoner now.
Aye, aye, sir.
Man the capstan.
Ready to talk yet, Mrs.
Beard?
No!
Take her away, Mr. Beamish.
Aye, aye, sir.
Down.
Give them a taste of the lash before they've done anything.
Preventive punishment, that's the principle.
Yes, sir.
That man yawned.
Give him a swimming lesson.
What, what?
Hey!
No.
Come on, wait a minute!
Wait a minute.
No.
Hey!
Thanks.
Well done, sir.
Hold the line.
Lovely day.
No!
No!
No!
Oh, no!
Oh, no!
Oh, what have we here?
A laggard?
Oh, it's so hard on a manicure, isn't it?
Not to worry, lad.
You'll get the hang of it.
And third, Your Majesty...
I'm very pleased to report... that after several very brave... and very expensive battles... the pirate Yellowbeard... is now well and truly... in our grasp.
Sir, is that, strictly speaking, accurate, sir?
Mansell, that's what we in the Royal Navy call a lie.
A lie, sir?
But that's treason, isn't it?
Be quiet.
Yes, sir.
Now get that off to Her Majesty right away.
Yes, sir.
How, sir?
By pigeon, Mansell.
Pigeon, sir?
Surely you didn't forget to bring the pigeon, Mansell?
Come in.
I think she might be ready to talk now, sir.
Right.
I seem to remember something about an island.
It must have been that shark what jogged my memory.
Jolly good, Ensign.
Thank you, sir.
Well done.
Shall I meet you in the pump room, sir?
Sit down, Mrs.
Beard.
Now, about this island.
A little pigeon, perhaps?
I've just ate some tuna, thank you.
Where did I put that treasure?
No, it's stagger.
No, no, no.
Get shot, then fall... then crawl, crawl... then stagger, stagger.
Do you know that you have three paying passengers onboard... who are being treated as abominably as the rest of the crew?
Really?
I think once the Captain realizes who we are, we'll get an easier passage.
Perfect.
Let's go.
Well, I can see there's only one thing you'll understand.
And what, pray, might that be?
Right!
Let's finish it!
I'm so sorry, sir.
What for?
Interrupting you, sir.
I was only smoking a cigar.
Yes, sir.
I came to tell you that the son of Yellowbeard the pirate is onboard this ship.
The son of Yellowbeard the pirate?
Who's that?
That was Mr.
Crisp, sir.
Mr.
Crisp?
Officers and men of The Lady Edith... these three people posing as pressees, are, in fact... foul stowaways.
Stowaways?
No!
The perspicacity of Mr.
Moon... has led to the discovery of a conspiracy against the Crown.
There's no doubt in my mind that the one in the middle... is the son of the evil Yellowbeard.
Yellowbeard!
He has already dispatched... dear Mr.
Crisp to the deep... clearly with the purpose of taking over this vessel.
We shall deliver these traitors to the proper authorities.
Set course for Portsmouth.
You know what to do, Mr.
Moon.
Mutiny.
Oh, dear, the Captain would appear to be out of sorts!
We're gonna have to choose a new captain.
Who shall it be?
Me!
No.
We want Dan!
Dan?
Or the prostitute.
Dan.
Who?
Who?
Come on!
Dan!
Dan!
Dan!
We want Dan!
Dan!
It's unanimous, then.
The ship's yours, Captain... to take where you will.
That's it, that's it.
I hope you don't mind us tying up the Captain like that, sir.
No, not at all.
Well, I was only following your lead.
I mean, well, your killing Mr.
Crisp was an example to us all.
But I only hit him with a bucket, and then everything went blank.
Oh, yeah.
It's like that, killing.
No hard feelings, Captain Hughes.
Your consideration will be noted.
Now, Bosun, set course for Madagascar.
Yes.
Right!
You heard what the Captain said.
It's Madagascar.
Aye, aye, sir.
Set a course for Portsmouth, Mr. Martin.
Aye, aye, sir!
East by northeast, Mr. Prostitute.
Aye, aye, sir.
All's well!
Ah... S'well!
We went 10 degrees west off course overnight.
Did you notice that, Mr.
Moon?
Indeed I did, sir.
Our captain didn't bump the helmsman off last night, did he?
No.
Didn't leave his cabin, Mr.
Moon.
Did you order a change of course?
No.
I think someone knows where the island is.
See?
They're leading us right to it.
Come on, Mrs.
Beard.
We've been at this all day.
No.
No.
That still doesn't look right.
I don't think you're being as helpful as you promised, Mrs.
Beard.
I'm doing my best.
Perhaps a little more shark treatment?
Nothing in sight, sir.
Absolutely nothing at all.
Nothing, sir!
Talk about clear horizons, this is it.
We've been at sea for weeks without sighting anything, let alone The Edith.
Ship ahoy!
Look lively, lads.
Look lively.
There you are, sir.
Nothing again.
Nothing whatsoever.
Behind you, Mansell.
I know you are, sir.
There's a ship behind you.
Good lord, sir!
It's The Edith!
Sir?
Of course it's The Edith, Mansell.
But, sir... it is behind us, and we're supposed to be following it, sir.
Well, how can we be, sir?
Strike the colors, Mr. Beamish.
Strike the colors, Mr. Beamish.
Hoist the French flag.
Hoist the French flag.
Hard about.
Hard about.
They mustn't know we're after them, Mansell.
If we can convince them we're French, they'll avoid us.
Perhaps then we can return to following them discreetly.
What sort of ship is it?
Some kind of frigate.
We wouldn't have come across it, if we had kept our course.
No, no.
We wouldn't.
There's a flag.
They're French, and they're rounding on us!
Stand by to fire.
Oh, dear.
Stand by to hide.
All right, Mansell, so we'll just sail quietly past, all right?
Aye, aye, sir.
Ready?
Fire!
Are you all right, Mansell?
Yes, thank you, sir.
Shit.
What do the fools think they're doing?
We outgun them.
We outman them.
We're much faster than they are.
I think it might have something to do with the French flag we're flying, sir.
All right, then to avoid suspicion, we better appear to retaliate.
We'll fire a bit and miss a lot.
Fire!
Lower the guns!
Fire!
Raise the guns!
Fire!
More sail!
More sail!
Clear the debris!
Clear the debris!
Carpenters to action!
Carpenters to action!
Jettison some ballast, Mr. McKenzie.
We must sail as fast as we can without our sail.
Well done, lad!
This calls for a celebration.
Well done, Captain.
Oh, yes.
No disrespect intended, Your Lordship.
Straight back, head up and thrust.
Well done, Son.
Straight back, head up and thrust.
Captain.
Get out, you coward.
Ebenezer.
Yes, Percy?
I've been thinking.
Oh, yes?
Can brandy make you see things?
If you drink enough of it.
Oh, that explains it.
That island I thought I saw.
Island?
It is an island.
Of course.
It's beautiful.
Prepare the longboat, Mr. Tarbuck.
Aye, aye, sir.
Now, men, a group of us are going to put ashore here for provisions.
Provisions.
Oh, yes.
Of course, sir.
Could be a mirage.
Looks rather like a mirage I once saw.
If I saw it.
Is it anything like the map on my head?
This is the island.
I gladly moisten your foot with my nostrils, Your Barbarity.
I have something very nice to show you.
Excellent.
So, explain to me, Seor Verdugo... the intricacies of this most holy instrument of confession.
Triola, I don't think you should see this, my daughter.
It's only another torture machine.
I want it to be a surprise for you.
Later, my sweet.
All right, Daddy.
So, my new confessional.
Yes, of course.
But first, Your Severity, you will notice that the instrument... is completely surrounded by this pool of acid... which will destroy anything thrown into it... except gold and precious stones.
But flesh and bone and iron...
Observe.
Voil!
And it doesn't dissolve gold, you say?
No.
Not, of course.
Of course not, Your Vapidity.
Even if they have swallowed their valuables, Your Severity... there would be no need for those messy searches that we used to have.
Unless we want one.
Of course, Your Outrageousness.
So this is my new confessional?
Yes, it is.
It works this way, Your Ferocity.
If you will, please.
The prisoner... is totally restrained... by means of this iron banding.
Excellent.
Excellent.
But there is more to it than that, Your Blizzard of the Wrong.
By means of these ratchets and these screws... you can place his body in any position that you want... for as long as you want and do anything to it that you want.
You can break every bone in his hand... one at a time.
And feet?
And the feet.
I love it.
And the back?
And the back.
And slowly crush them and break them?
Oh, yes.
It is very effective, Your Acute Horrendousness.
People will be even more frightened of me when they hear I have this.
Oh, yes, definitely, Your Blind Stupidity.
Even you, Seor Verdugo?
Well, of course not me.
I mean, after all, I made it.
I designed it.
It's my baby.
Well, let's see if it works.
If it does not work, I shall dispatch you with heavenly force.
Well, we could all do with some good food and clean water.
Mr.
Moon, prepare a hunting party.
Aye, aye, sir.
Why don't you go ahead and forage... and me and a few of the lads'll stay behind and guard the boat?
Very good, Mr.
Moon.
There's a beach like this, which ought to be on the other side of the island.
We'll cover more ground if we separate.
We'll have every gun on that ship ready for them when they return.
Bosun Gilbert.
Aye, aye, Captain Moon.
Bloody murderers.
Unhand me, you heathens.
Percy...
I think I found the tree that that paralyzing liquid comes from.
Just stab some under the skin and... You do what?
Stab some... Oh, that.
They've captured Dan.
Ebenezer, look.
Who?
Shall we send for reinforcements... or capture them now?
Wait a minute.
What's that?
Good Lord.
How did he get here?
There's our reinforcement.
Seems to have taken a mild dislike to the priests.
Come on, men.
Let's rescue Captain Dan.
Not likely, mate.
And the treasure.
Right you are, mate.
Be right with you.
No, no, I can't.
Leave me alone.
Come on, come on, please.
He'll come back.
He'll kill you.
You see?
Your Assholiness.
Greetings, Your Vehemence.
Mission accomplished.
By the grace of God and heavenly force... five heathen souls have attained eternal serenity.
Only five?
Was there any money?
On the paltry side, Your Barbarity.
So your mission was as so much fart gas.
Oh, no, Your Offensiveness.
The ship that they came on was after Yellowbeard's treasure.
Yellowbeard?
Oh, no, no.
He is not here.
Just the men who came looking for his treasure.
This is one of their officers, Your Molestation.
The treasure of Yellowbeard.
Now I am the richest... You must find out everything he knows.
I have just the thing.
Oh, my head.
And my foot and my back.
Mon Dieu, it works.
You may torture me, but it will avail you nothing.
We'll see about that, sailor.
Captain Moon, sir, they've captured Dan, and they're setting a trap for the others.
Excellent.
They're making it easy for us.
Well done, Gilbert.
Is it too cold for you?
No, I'm all right.
You must tell my father where the treasure is, or you will surely die.
I'll tell him nothing.
But he only wants it for the grace and glory of God.
What kind of God is it that kills and tortures men?
My father's only purpose is to enable heathen souls... to enter heaven more rapidly than they would of their own accord.
Please tell him.
It hurts me to see you hurt.
It hurts me to see you be hurt by me being hurt.
I think I love you.
You're right, you do.
And I love you.
And when I am rescued, I want you to come with me.
But to come with you would mean leaving here.
Are you taking the treasure?
That's right.
Triola, you realize your father may be killed?
Oh, Daddy won't mind.
He's a bit odd about things like that.
I must pack my things.
Excuse me, Your Monstrosity.
Our prisoner here must be very importante.
There seems to be quite a little army gathering down there.
Could it be their leader?
No.
But there is a man of very high rank giving orders.
He would know where the treasure is.
He is the one we must capture.
That would be very difficult, O Berserk One.
He would be the last in the attack and the first to escape.
Typical leader for you.
What did you say?
I said, except for you, O Mindless Slaughterer.
That's the answer.
Yeah.
We will lure their leader to the front by allowing their attack to succeed.
Yes.
We will pretend to resist and fake injury and death when they attack.
Excuse me, why are you banging your head like that?
Was I?
Yes, you was.
We all seen you, you silly man.
Excuse me.
Yes, and when the invaders reach the throne room, my men will rise up... and dispatch all with majestic heavenly force.
Magnificent strategy, Your Arrogance.
But it must look realistic.
Anyone caught overacting...
I will personally scare to death.
Alms for the poor.
Social parasite.
Take the donkey.
My bowl.
Where is my bowl?
Come on, burro!
Hold on, men.
This way.
Welcome to our trap.
Come on, Ebenezer.
Now everyone wait for my signal.
Oh, except you.
That is pathetic!
What?
What about this, sir?
Go back to your position.
Go on!
So far, so good.
This way, men.
Vasquez, don't overdo it.
Alms for the poor.
On guard.
And you.
Jolly good.
Touch.
Good shot.
Look at this, sir.
This is terrible!
I will have no more bad acting!
That was great.
Bravo.
Cool.
Bravo.
What do you make of it?
Dead.
Entirely.
Release that man.
You have fallen for one of my least likely plans.
Stand up, men.
Come on, you guys.
Up.
Up.
I administered a drop of this to them all... just as a precaution.
Well, then, you give me no choice.
I shall have to...
I shall have to... give up completely.
Sorry about that.
Sorry, sorry, everyone.
I'll go free your friend, then, shall I?
I'm much too fiendish for the likes of you white-faced persons.
Your friend, who you value so highly, is in my power.
Well, what sort of power?
What?
Well, what sort of power do you have?
My divine right to command over life and death.
That sort of power.
That sort of power, yes.
I thought perhaps you meant mechanical energy.
As ruler, my supremacy is absolute on this island.
I thought this was an atoll.
Not at all.
Not an atoll.
No, not an atoll?
Oh, no.
What is it, then?
This is an isthmus.
Isthmus.
Silence and obey, or I shall kill your captain.
Yellowbeard.
Father, we thought you were dead.
Us Yellowbeards are never more dangerous than when we're dead.
How you getting on pirating?
Well... How many men have you killed so far?
One.
Two, I think.
You think?
You'll never kill anyone if you go around thinking.
Triola.
I don't think you've met my father.
Been out raping, lad?
Nice work, lad.
No, I haven't raped her.
No, you wouldn't have, you poncey little git.
You're not the prawn of my loins.
Your mother's a bloody liar.
That's what I liked about her.
She couldn't be your mother.
No woman ever slept with me and lived.
What's happened to Daddy?
I killed him.
He's gone to heaven.
Oh, that's nice.
He sent all his friends there.
She's yours, is she then, Dan?
Let me have a bit of a prod at her first.
Father!
Captain Dan!
Captain Dan.
It's Mr... Who?
It's...
It's Mr.
Moon.
Moon?
That shithead Moon?
It's time I got rid of him.
Dad, stop.
Look, we'll all fight Mr.
Moon.
Oh, good.
Another battle.
Well done, Son.
Dan.
Come on, men.
Let's go get our treasure.
So long, mate.
Don't worry.
I'll spend your share.
No, you won't, Mr.
Moon.
It's little Captain Dan, huh?
Yellowbeard!
Moon, you bastard, what betrayed me.
I'm gonna make you eat both your own buttocks.
I've got a score to settle with you, Captain Yellowbeard.
Good girl.
Hold your throat on this sword.
He's all yours, lad.
Dan, watch out.
Get going!
Great shot, young lady.
Later, Triola.
I must find my father.
You mean Yellowbeard?
He went that way.
Well, Commander Clement...
I had high hopes you would consider sharing.
Just lead me to Yellowbeard's treasure, Mrs.
Beard.
That's all I want.
Right.
Well, as I recall... it should be in that direction.
Let's see, that's stagger, stagger, crawl, crawl... No, that's crawl, crawl.
Right.
Crawl, sir?
Come on, men.
Right, right.
Stagger, stagger, right and jump.
And stagger.
Jump.
Stagger, stagger, jump.
Jump.
Wait for me, sir.
It's quite good exercise this, really, isn't it?
Get shot, stagger, stagger, stagger... roll... stagger, stagger, stagger a little bit, then... stagger, stagger, crawl, stagger... stagger, stagger, roll... and crawl, crawl, crawl... stagger, stagger, stagger... Father, are you all right?
...stagger, stagger, stagger... Father?
You made me forget where I was, you stupid little sod.
What were you doing?
Shut up!
Did I just say stagger or was it crawl?
I don't know.
It was crawl.
But was it crawl to the right, crawl to the left... or crawl, crawl, then to the right, then stagger?
Or was it... Oh, bugger me, you've sodded the whole thing up... like the stupid little twerp that you are.
I was recreating what happened to me Why didn't you stay with us?
Because I wanted to betray you.
But why?
I had to.
Betraying's all part of pirating.
If you don't know that, you're not even close to being a pirate.
Prawn of my loins, my foot.
What?
You're either born a pirate or not.
It's in the blood, Dan, and it's not in your blood, or you'd have betrayed me long ago.
All right, I may not be a pirate, but at least I've got a brain in my head... so why don't we just follow the instructions?
Right.
Right.
Six paces north, left at the rock, then four paces west.
Right, come on, lad.
Give us a hand.
Stride, stride, stagger left... stride, stride, then dig.
Go on, make yourself useful, lad.
You know, the way you was fighting back there... there may be some pirate blood in you, after all.
Well, I did have a hand in forcing Mr.
Moon into the acid.
With your head on my shoulders, we can wreck civilization.
And stagger and jump and jump... Keep hopping.
...and stagger and stagger and jump.
Go on, Dan, use your dagger.
Look at it all.
Hip, hip, hooray!
Triola, we're rich.
Come on, Dan.
Congratulations, Father.
But I didn't... You are a Yellowbeard.
What?
Killing your father as I killed my father before me.
Dad, the blood.
Blood.
That's what I like to hear.
You are my son.
Halt, in the name of the law!
Well done there, lad.
Got him at last.
All right, men.
Keep your guns on him.
Hello, Dan.
Hello, lambchop.
Wonderful to see you.
Pity about your dad.
On the other hand, it is the way what he said he always wanted to go.
Horribly.
Commander Clement, Royal Navy.
I claim this treasure...
He claims it?
...in the name of Her Majesty, Queen Anne.
Dan, darling, I don't think I love you anymore.
You're right.
You don't.
Goodbye, Triola.
There's at least two more chests down there.
You'll be a duke now, sir.
Won't you, sir?
Duty, Mansell.
That's my reward.
Duke, eh?
You've got a lovely bottom, blue eyes.
I think I love you.
What?
She said you've got a lovely bottom, sir, and...
Shut up, Mansell.
Yes, sir.
Right, Mansell, clap those people in irons.
Sir.
You poor dear.
You must have suffered.
Tell me about it.
It was simply awful.
Sir, I was just thinking...
Her Majesty can have no idea... how much treasure we've got.
Can she, sir?
No, she can't.
Have one yourself.
Thank you, sir.
Or even where we are.
I say, sir.
Mansell, are you thinking what I think you're thinking?
I'll think whatever you say, sir.
Ever been to the Americas?
Us Yellowbeards are never more dangerous than when we're dead.
Dan.
I think I love you.
Come on, lad, there's pirating to be done.
I'm going to tell you a story about a boy who would never grow up, about the pirate who wished to kill him, about the island where fairies roamed.
But this isn't the story you've heard before, because sometimes friends begin as enemies, and enemies begin as friends.
Sometimes to truly understand how things end, we must first know how they begin.
Come on.
I love you, my son.
I love you, my Peter.
Wakey, wakey!
Rise and shine!
Come on, now.
That's it.
Come on.
Move along.
Come on, quickly now.
Peter, we'll miss breakfast.
The heroes have risen.
They must now feed!
Quiet over there!
I said quiet!
Eat that up!
Now.
I won't tell you again!
Where's the bacon?
We always have bacon rind of a weekend.
There's a war on, Peter.
Rationing.
You're lucky to have any food at all.
Oh!
Mother Barnabas, forgive me.
Get over there.
How much you wanna bet she's nickin' all the rations?
Shh.
She'll hear ya.
She's got ears like an elephant.
Bum like one, too.
Look.
More empty seats.
Nelson and Billy both got evacuated.
Lucky sods.
Both of them?
When?
Don't know.
When I woke up, they were both gone.
Off to some family in Canada until the war's over.
I wouldn't mind goin' there.
Don't be daft.
You gotta stay put.
For when our mums come fetch us?
Exactly.
We hunker down here.
Hold the fort.
Wait for the cavalry.
Now, get on that roof and clean those filthy gutters.
Is it safe, Mother Barnabas?
Well, I've not tested it meself, like.
You know, not recently.
But all the necessary paperwork is in order should an orphan perish in a fall.
Now get up there!
And while you're aloft and closer to our Lord, you may reflect on your festering souls.
Your souls that fester as do the leaves.
See!
I was right!
She's hoarding all the rations.
Where's she hiding all the grub?
Her office.
No one's ever been in there.
I heard a rumor it's booby trapped.
Silence, I said!
Quiet!
Everyone, down to the shelters!
In chaos is death!
Come on.
I don't like this.
Fort Knox.
The lair of the dragon.
Whoa!
Come here.
So put your hands there.
I need your shoe, fella.
Could you just... Quiet!
Right.
Nineteen.
Twenty.
Peter.
Ugh.
What a dirty old nun.
Ugh- This is so unhygienic.
Why is the Virgin Mary so clean?
Nibs?
Down here!
Nibsy!
I told ya.
Booby trapped.
It's a treasure trove.
Flippin' heck!
Peter!
It's the records.
Peter!
It's your file.
Is it from your mum?
What does she say?
I can't.
Will you read it?
I meant aloud.
Oh.
"My dearest Peter.
"Everything I have done, "I have done because I love you.
"I long for the day that I can come back for you "and explain everything.
"Don't doubt me "nor most importantly, "don't doubt yourself.
"You are extraordinary. "
"More than you can imagine. "
I promise that you will see me again, in this world or another.
Come on!
That's my private property!
Give it back!
You know, Peter, every little orphan dreams he's special.
That he'll be the one whose mother comes a- skipping back for him.
But your mammy's not for skipping.
And why is that, hmm?
Because you're not special, Peter.
GRUNTS) You're not even special in your own way.
You're just a nasty little creature abandoned by a feckless mammy who's forgotten you exist.
Oh!
You little savage!
Hands!
The both of ya!
He never did nothin'!
He's guilty by association.
It is time for the pine.
Oi, Skinny.
Arnold and the twins, when did they go?
Me guess it were last night.
All the missing children, all that dough hidden in her office.
What's Barnabas up to?
She's selling orphans.
I knew it!
I mean, is she?
That's not nice.
But who in the world buys orphans at night?
That's what we have to find out.
Now, come on, let's make a plan.
It'll be fun.
I've heard that one before.
Cor!
Who guffed one?
Nibs y!
Ineven Mmm-mmm.
Mmm-mmm.
This was a stupid plan.
I'm going back to bed.
Come on.
Night.
Night.
Nibs!
Peter!
I told you it would happen tonight.
I was right!
What?
Head for the stairs.
Go!
Nibs!
Goodbye, Peter!
You're comin' with me!
Let go!
Peter.
Holy pudding!
Prepare to set sail!
We've gotta get out of here.
We'll have to jump.
I can't!
We have to!
Come on!
Nibs!
And away we go!
Come on!
Friends till death!
Peter!
Damnation.
You've sunk my frigate.
Ma'am.
Luftwaffe.
Inbound.
Ladies.
Sector 6, sector 8, sector 12.
Incoming!
Spitfire!
Clear the deck!
Ready your swords!
Oh, come on!
Ma'am, regarding identification of the enemy, um, aircraft, it rather resembles a, um...
Spit it out, man.
It looks like a pirate ship, ma'am.
Come again?
PIRATE; Fire!
Whoa!
{GROANS) (WHIMPERS) Get off.
Don't go dying- You're precious cargo.
Am I?
Somebody thinks so.
Is it my mother?
Going UP!
Whoa.
Get out here!
You little rat!
Make your move!
Come on, hurry up!
Move it!
Come on!
Right this ship for docking.
Haul away!
Come on, fellas.
ORPHAN 13 Look!
It's daylight.
I wanna see this!
What is that?
Move, I can't see.

You who weep molten pearls of innocent tears, dry them, dear nippers.
For I have sprung you from life's cruel dungeon, and hereby grant you liberty!
Suffer no more.
Come unto me.
You are home.
Here you join orphans alike from every corner of the globe, every race, creed, and color.
Every age and era.
You are pioneers.
Brave creators of a new society.
For this, my poppets, is a land of opportunity!
My justice is divine.
My laws are so simple you could write them on a pig's ear.
In fact, I have.
Law number one, "Those who work with bright, honest vigor "will be rewarded with prizes "and trophies "and confectionery!"
Law number two, "Those who fail to work hard, "those who skive or malinger, "will hereby know the brooding majesty of my disapproval. "
Mark me well.
I know no pity.
No second chances.
I don't do mercy.
But remember, don't forget to help yourselves to lots and lots of jolly old fun!
Hey, kiddiewinks, welcome to Neverland!
Put some effort into it.
You better find me some Pixum!
Harder!
Work harder!
Uh, Sam Smiegel, supervisor.
No, thank you.
Take it off.
Whoa!
Excuse me.
What are we digging for?
Did no one explain?
We are mining for these little chaps.
Fairy dust, otherwise known as Pixum.
Fairies are real?
Mmm.
They were real, yeah.
There were millions of them all over the island.
What happened to 'em?
Oh, Blackbeard hunted them into extinction.
Why?
For the fairy dust.
You know, the old Pixum.
What does he want it for?
I don't have no idea.
No one knows.
No one's allowed to know.
Well, you best not dwell on it.
Just... Get a move on!
Real, actual fairies.
HOOK".
Hey, new kid, you just got here on a flying pirate ship.
"Real" should be a very fluid concept for you right now.
Get to diggin'.
Give me your pick, kid.
Your hand's all messed up because your blade is blunted.
If you keep swingin' like that, you're gonna break your wrist.
I'm Peter.
How long have you been here?
Forever.
Do you know why they want it so badly?
The Pixum?
You ask too many questions, kid.
They kill for it.
We die for it.
End of story.
Thanks very much.
Don't thank me.
I don't care about you.
I'm not your friend, and I haven't got your back.
Simple as that.
Shoo, kid.
Fairy dust.
I found some.
That's mine!
No!
I found some!
Oi, thief!
I found it!
Oi, small fry, button it.
Move!
Give it to me.
It was me!
I found the fairy Pixum!
This bogey stole it.
He said he found it.
That means he found it.
Clear?
Clear as the scar on your ugly face!
Take him to the Captain!
Disorder and verbals.
Move out of the way.
Move it.
Get out of the way!
There...
There is a procedure for this, you know.
You're not supposed to...
Shut it, Mr. Clipboard.
Oh!
Let's see what Blackbeard makes of this nasty little thief.
Oh, what you lookin' at?
I was tryin' my best.
Well, go on, then.
Back to work.
Thank you.
Did you find the natives' camp?
They found us, sir.
They sprang from the trees and laid waste to 40 of our most formidable men.
Then they disappeared back into the forest as if they were never there.
Whoa.
Whoa.
Whoa.
We will get them, Captain.
Given the proper time.
Time?
Mmm.
I have sucked these mines dry.
There's almost nothing left.
I must have their lands.
But these savages continue to ambush my ships, operating from some hidden camp, which no one can seem to find.
And yet you assure me all will be well given the proper time.
There is no time!
None!
Oh...
Excuse me, Captain.
Hey ho.
The show must go on.
How do the miners seem?
Dirty, feverish, on the brink of collapse, sir.
Why must it be so hard?
So... Who are we making an example of today?
Hey ho, let's go!
Hey ho, let's go!
a' They're forming in a straight line a' They're going through a tight wind a' No, no!
What's going on?
What do you think?
They're piling in the backseat 4' They're generating steam heat a' Pulsating to the backbeat a' The Blitzkrieg Bop A' Any clearer now?
Hey ho, let's go!
a' Hey ho, let's go!
a' BLACKBEARDI Yeah!
Brave heroes of Neverland, behold these traitors.
I entrust their fate to your gracious whim.
This barbarian... ...caught stealing from the grain store.
...was caught squealing from the grain store.
Stealing.
Stealing.
Twice.
Twice!
Will you spare him?
No!
Or do you lust for justice?
Justice!
Yes!
Justice!
Do they ever have mercy?
Oh, yes.
They do.
Often?
Uh... Let's go!
Don't answer that.
This boy has been in our mines but one day and has already proven himself to be a thief, a rabble rouser, and a Pixum fraudster.
I never!
I ask, shall you have mercy for the willful child?
ALL; No!
Or do ye be nasty?
Nasty!
Nasty!
Nasty!
Nasty!
Alack.
The people have spoken.
Think a happy thought.
I'll be darned.
I don't believe it!
I can fly!
%THUDS) (PETER GROANS) Neverland is a dream from which you never wake.
Ever had that one?
A dreadful nightmare you know is not real, but your sleep is so heavy, so deep, so delicious that you just can't wake up.
Drowning in sleep.
Slow dream drowning in the soft, black sea.
Do you know that sea, Peter?
It's death, boy.
Murmuring to you.
It's where we end.
Most of us.
Would you like some chocolate?
Childhood ain't so jolly.
In fact, it's rather frightening.
A9 Fee?
Are you brave, Peter?
I try to be.
Yes, of course.
Are you scared?
Yes.
Have you ever flown before?
No.
Beyond that wall, there are savage people.
They have an ancient prophecy from when the fairy kingdoms reigned on this island.
The prophecy tells of a boy born of the love between a fairy prince and a human girl.
A boy who would be disappeared from this world until he was old enough to return and lead an uprising against me.
A boy, so says the prophecy, who could fly.
Have you come to kill me, Peter?
I don't believe in bedtime stories.
"Me... Me.
"Huh... Eh... "Er... " I promise that you will see me again, in this world or another.
"Or another. "
Go on!
Get in there!
"Or another. "
Hey, flyboy.
Yeah?
That was some little airshow you put on out there.
Could you do that again?
Who wants to know?
Of course I can fly.
You saw me.
Hmm.
Good.
Put your ear to that wall over there.
Now that's the sound of a blast cap I stuck to the other side.
Set to go off in 30 seconds.
If I fly, you'll help me find my mother?
I reckon she's here on the island.
It's not a negotiation, kid.
Without me, you're stuck in this cell.
Without me, you're stuck in these mines.
Okay, then we'll talk about it.
Just move away from that wall before you get yourself blown up, all right?
So, what's it gonna be?
Kid!
Tick took.
Okay, we have a deal, just... Flyboy?
Hurry!
Slide down.
They'll be comin' for us.
If I'm gonna trust you, I need to know your name.
It's Hook.
The name's James Hook.
"Happy?
No!
Left foot in front of the other, put the right one in front of the other.
That's it.
It's called walking.
Off you go.
Go on.
Smee.
Well, go on, then.
Carry on.
Smee.
Down here!
Whoa.
Six o'clock.
I don't...
Yes... HOOK".
Darn it, Smee, in the basket.
Please don't call me Smee.
Smee, can you get me to the surface?
There is no use.
Once you're up there, you can't get anywhere else.
Not today.
Good knowing ya.
You've been a true friend.
Someday I'll find a way to repay you.
Now, send us up.
What the heck?
You just said someday you'll find a way to repay me.
Someday, not today.
Get out!
I think that's a very minor technicality.
Someday could be today, if you think about it.
And, moreover... Smee!
Yes.
That's where we're headed.
The Skyport.
We can take one of the cable cars up to the dock.
Then you'll fly us to a ship.
Okay?
Huh?
Keep your head down, kid.
GO!
Go!
See?
They anchor the galleons far enough off the dock, so they're impossible to steal.
So you want me to fly from the dock, over to one of the... What?
Speak now, or forever hold your peace.
Are we meant to have stopped?
PETER; Whoa.
Heave!
Heave!
Forget the Skyport.
You have to do it now.
Are you waiting for a formal invitation?
Go!
Now!
I'm afraid of heights!
What?
You can fly!
Yesterday was my first time.
Well, you better fly again, or we're all gonna fall for the last time.
Might we bicker about this later?
Smee!
The sword!
Yeah, that's gonna work, kid.
Get up there and wave it at 'em.
Heave!
That was close.
Do you know how to work a ship?
How hard could it be?
Smee!
The rope!
Yes!
Yes!
Clear!
Boy!
Whoa!
This is a lot harder than it looks!
Yeah!
We're sailin' now!
Well, do you have anything to say?
I worked really hard setting up that table.
What?
Forget the table.
Pick them up later.
If that boy makes it to the natives, you can forget any chance of us winning this war.
All will be lost.
We'll find them, sir.
They can't have gone far.
Well, then where are they?
Get me that boy before the savages do!
Dead ahead!
Ahhh!
Smee!
Get off my leg!
I think I'm gonna be sick!
The wall!
The wall!
Somebody, please help me!
Turn!
Smee!
Get the sails up!
We need a strong headwind to make the jump!
What jump?
Home!
We're gettin' the heck off this island!
No-ho!
You said we'd find my mother!
I'm not leaving Neverland!
Well, not now, anyway!
Get the sails up!
The sails!
This is gonna be a little rough!
Put the sails up!
How many times...
I am not to be disturbed when I'm at the Rejuvenator!
Yes?
I am sorry, Captain, but it's about the boy.
Mmm-hmm?
The stolen ship went down in the Neverwood.
So the boy is lost?
Yes, sir.
He is a lost boy.
But our best men are searching for him now.
I am surrounded by imbeciles.
Must I do everything myself?
Sir, you can't really believe that this pipsqueak is the one.
He hardly seems capable.
His mother hardly seemed capable either, and yet, here we are.
The deal was to help me find my mother.
You were gonna break it.
That's very wrong.
No, you broke the deal first.
You lied to us.
No, I fibbed.
I can fly.
Just not every day.
Whoa!
Our only way off this island and now it's in pieces.
Satisfied?
Well, yes.
I'm quite content.
'Cause I don't wanna get off this island.
All the years that I've wasted planning to get out.
All gone.
Hey!
Quit messing around.
It's not safe in here.
PETER".
Every ship has one.
A what?
PETER".
A map.
What does that say?
"Tribal Territory. "
Exactly.
The prophecy said, "A boy would lead the tribe. "
So what?
You don't care.
I do.
Keep going.
Well, Blackbeard thinks the prophecy is about me, which means my mum is from here, which means the natives might know where she is.
HOOK".
Are you insane?
Those savages would just as soon kill you as help you.
Ever met one?
No!
And I don't plan to.
Well, they might be very nice.
I'm not afraid of 'em.
There's a fine line between bravery and suicide, kid.
I'm off to go find the Tribal Territory.
Oh, goodbye!
He won't last an hour out there.
His problem.
Not ours.
Thing is, if he was the chosen one...
If that prophecy is real, trust me, he ain't it.
But if they thought he was...
They believed he was...
I bet they'd handsomely reward anyone who brought him to them.
Well, they haven't got a ship.
Yeah, but they could get one.
Who's fought the pirates more than the natives?
If anyone could find a way, it's them.
Just remember, when we find those oh-so-sweet-natured locals, true or not, you tell them you're their savior.
Then, we'll go our separate ways.
Got it?
Why would you want to leave a place like this?
Where will you go?
I don't know.
Somewhere I'm a little higher up on the food chain, for starters.
What was that?
Somethin' a little higher up on the food chain.
Oh.
Oh, that is pretty, Hook.
Do you see that?
We got pirates tryin' to shoot us down with cannons.
Nearly falling a thousand feet to our deaths.
Twice.
Shipwrecked.
And you see something like that and you think to yourself, "Oh, worth it. "
Are you an orphan?
My ma left me.
That count?
Well, do you remember her?
I'm not wasting tears missing someone who never missed me.
Maybe she does.
How can you know?
Do you really believe your mum's here?
Well, she left me a note saying... Oh, well, if she left you a note, sure.
Just 'cause yours never loved you... Stop.
...doesn't mean my mum never loved me.
Stop talking right now.
Did you hear that?
It was a deafening nightmare shriek.
How can anyone not have heard... Shh.
That's a Neverbird.
And so is that.
What're we gonna do?
We need a plan.
We need a plan!
Run!
We'll lose them in the mist!
Go!
Go!
Run, Smee!
Their faces are terrible, but their feathers are quite lovely.
Shut up and run!
Go!
Smee!
Peter!
Hook?
Is that you?
Peter.
Hook, they've got Smee.
No.
Don't worry.
Everything's gonna be all right!
I knew we'd find the natives.
We're saved.
Please!
I'm ready to go home now, please.
Let me handle this.
Good fair lady.
We come in peace.
And with treasure.
May I proudly present to you... Pan!
Pan!
Pan!
Pan!
Pan!
Pan!
Pan!
Pan!
Pan!
Smee!
Smee!
What?
What are they singing about?
Search me!
ALL; Pan!
Pan!
What's going on?
What's "Pan"?
The Pan is our tribe's bravest warrior.
It's our tradition to grant you the chance to win your freedom before we kill you and your friends.
Kill?
What do you mean, "kill"?
You are our sworn enemy.
You're pirates.
Pirates?
We're not pirates.
Hold on!
The kid is the one you've been waiting for.
Listen!
Your chance to live, your fiercest fighter against ours.
Our Pan.
You win, you live.
You lose...
I get the idea.
Huh?
Bye for now.
Pan!
So how do we know when to start?
Whoa.
Whoa!
Whoa!
"Oh!
Smee!
What?
We have to tell them about my mother.
No one cares about your darn mother!
Sorry, that was a bit harsh.
Ahh!
%GROANS) (ALL GASP) Okay.
Your Highness.
I was hoping to get you alone.
Stop!
The little one.
He wears the Pan.
He's a boy that can fly.
I've seen it.
It's terrific.
We call this the Memory Tree.
It was a time of war.
Blackbeard destroyed everything in pursuit of the Pixum.
But then, the chief made a pact with the great fairy king, uniting our peoples against the pirates.
One night, the king's son, the fairy prince, found his way onto Blackbeard's ship.
Her name was Mary, the love of Blackbeard's life and his most prized possession.
Night after night, the prince visited Mary.
But when Blackbeard discovered them, he flew into a jealous rage.
So in order to save her, the prince took human form.
But though fairies can live many thousands of years, in human flesh, they can live only one day.
The prince sacrificed his life for the girl he loved.
And the child of that love was you.
Our people helped your mother hide you in the other world.
And they made you this totem, so that when you returned, we would know it was you.
What happened to my mother?
She returned to the Neverwood and fought for us many years.
And?
The pirates were winning the war, and the fairies had to retreat to a hidden kingdom.
They've remained there, in hiding, unknown by Blackbeard until a time when they can reemerge and fight.
And my mother?
She's with them.
She's alive?
Are you sure?
I have to go to her!
Please, take me now!
No.
You must be patient.
But she's waiting for me.
The fairy kingdom is the greatest secret of this land.
Our duty is to protect it.
Before we take you there, you must prove yourself to be Mary's son.
The one we've been waiting for.
When the third moon rises, he must fly.
If he lives, he's the one.
One second.
And if he dies?
He's an imposter.
His death Will be justified.
Three days!
I've got the necklace.
Isn't that enough?
You could've stolen it.
But I didn't.
Tell her!
Kid's always had that thing.
How long have you known him?
Three days.
All my life.
The flying thing is a stupid detail.
Why can't they just see that?
If you don't believe, Peter, then neither will they.
But if you do, they will, too.
I promise.
Are you who they think you are?
I don't know.
Hey.
They think you're their messiah, that you're here to liberate them.
Are they right?
I said, I don't know!
Rabbits.
Ibeheve.
I can fly!
If only Nibs was here.
He'd know how to help.
I believe.
Have you seen Smee?
These things they expect me to do, I can't do them, Hook.
I've tried.
Hey.
Stop.
Hey!
I can't do the things, so I can't be the one!
Listen.
Hook, what the bloody hell am I?
You can go feeling sorry for yourself all you want, kid.
But knowing where you're from, that's half of knowing who you are.
That's more than most of us here will ever know.
But you said that your mother left you.
Yeah.
I lied.
I do that sometimes.
It's called being a grown-up!
Least you know where you come from.
Born to a warrior, heir to a prince.
Does that mean you're the one?
I don't know.
I don't know if there is a "one. "
But I do know that if you aren't the guy, and you are just you, maybe that's enough.
Where's the boy?
Spill the beans, or I'll spill your blood.
I'll never tell.
He's right over there.
Nope, nope.
Wait, my mistake.
Pretty sure it's that way.
No!
No.
Right the first time.
Definitely, maybe definitely, this way.
The point is, we're very close.
Ready the ships.
Bishop, kill him.
No!
Just wait!
Wait!
You might not wanna kill me just yet.
For I hold the crown jewels, you know.
Informationally.
Speak.
Sorry, a bit nervous.
You are quite intimidating.
Speak!
Now, you know the so-called extinct fairy kingdom, hmm?
Speak.
Sorry.
I was just lookin' for you.
Well, you found me.
Don't see things like that in the mines.
Kinda beautiful.
So, do you like sunrises?
What is it you think you're doing?
Well, I think it's called flirting, but if you have to ask, I might be doin' it wrong.
You're not like the men from my tribe.
Thank you.
No, they're honest.
Oh.
Strong.
Brave.
Brave.
That what you call it?
Letting my little buddy take a leap to his death.
When he ceases to doubt himself, he will fly.
How do we know there are any fairies still left on this island or that they'll come help fight just 'cause they see him fly?
You have to trust us.
Why should we?
You certainly don't trust us.
There's a map to the fairy kingdom.
We guard it with our lives.
Of course there is.
Why wouldn't there be a secret map to the secret kingdom?
This isn't a game.
You've seen what Blackbeard has done to Neverland already.
He'll reduce the rest of it to nothing but mine pits if we don't stop him.
Has anybody ever told you you have really beautiful eyes?
Fire on the foredeck, prepare to come around.
Tiger Lily!
You missed.
Ha-ha!
We must find Peter!
Shoot her!
Peter!
Where's Hook?
All of this because of you.
No, Kwahu, wait!
You're welcome.
Now, come on.
Keep moving!
BLACKBEARD'.
Well, Well, Well.
The princess, I presume.
Oh, well, actually, I'm just a miner, but I appreciate the compliment.
Bishop.
Go on.
Line them up.
Down here.
All these years digging our hands raw for tiny lumps of Pixum, and now I learn from Mr. Smee you know where there's a mountain of the stuff.
Nice as pie.
Tell me where the boy is and how to find the fairy kingdom, and you may live.
Death is the greatest adventure.
Ben voyage.
All hail the new Chiefette.
Princess Tiger Lily.
All hail!
Tell him.
He'll kill you.
He's right, you know.
Nice birdie.
There's a map.
Traitor.
HOOK".
Don't shoot her.
She told me there's a map to the fairy kingdom.
Traitor!
How dare you betray us, pirate?
I'm trying to save your lives, sweetheart.
It won't happen again.
Oh, it won't, I guarantee it.
Captain.
Go, kid.
Yeah!
Kill them all!
Whoa!
Attack.
Attack!
No!
Can I tell you something, Peter?
You'll never find your mother.
Yes, I will find her.
No, you really, really won't.
You'll never find your mother.
Do you know why?
Because I killed her.
She died at my hand.
By this very blade.
As you will, too.
Close your eyes, Peter, and think a happy thought.
Bad form, sir!
We have to run, now!
No.
We have to jump.
Peter, are you hurt?
Well, I'm fine, too.
Thanks for asking.
Don't speak to me.
Because of you, everything my people have fought to protect will be destroyed.
Hey!
Because of you, the Chief is dead.
Smee was the rat.
He was your friend.
How was I supposed to know?
You should've known.
I'm sorry.
You should've known.
I'm sorry if I did something wrong!
Where's Peter?
Peter.
You lied.
You all lied.
I'm sorry.
So, it's true?
It's complicated.
Is my mother alive or isn't she?
Blackbeard spoke the truth.
And you lied to me.
Had we told you she was dead, you'd have walked away from your destiny.
Whoever it is you think I am, whatever it is you expect me to be, I'm not.
And I can't.
I couldn't...
I didn't wanna watch you die.
You should've closed your eyes.
Blackbeard won't stop searching for Peter.
There's only one place on this island he wouldn't dare look.
Mermaid Lagoon?
Sounds pretty.
So pirates are afraid of mermaids?
Because of what we will pass through to get there.
Yeah?
Crocodiles.
Afraid?
No, ma'am.
Find the map.
Keep looking.
Does Smee please thee?
Pull the place apart!
So may Smee be free?
No, you're too useful.
But Smee was promised... Smee should cease to talk of himself in the third person, or Smee will be a non-person.
Yes.
I found it.
It's a map to the fairy kingdom.
Ready the ships!
We must get there before Peter.
Grab the torches.
They're afraid of the light.
Did we scare 'em off?
Oh, come on.
They can fly?
Keep waving the torches.
There!
Peter!
Peter!
I think I see him.
Where?
Reach for my hand!
Help!
Help!
Peter.
What happened?
What the heck are those?
I don't know, but I think you're gonna like 'em.
You could say that again.
Hey, hey, hey.
Don't go.
I'm gonna check it out.
Be careful.
Who's more careful than me?
I'm sorry I didn't tell you what happened to your mother.
But Blackbeard didn't tell you the whole truth either.
Let me show you.
The mermaids charged these waters with memories.
You can see the past.
Deep breath.
There's no time.
Blackbeard's men nearly have us.
Go to the fairy kingdom.
Hide.
Keep our people safe.
You should never have come back, Mary.
And yet, here you are.
Ready to die for them rather than live with me.
No.
Mary.
No!
No.
No!
She was a warrior.
A great warrior.
Her sacrifice still inspires us.
Did you know her?
She trained me.
Would she have been proud of me?
Yes.
Very.
But what if I can't do what she did?
What if I fail to fulfill the prophecy?
And what if you fail to try, Peter?
What are you then?
HOOK".
Hey!
You've gotta see this.
Now, the hull's a little banged up.
And see those teeth marks?
Boy, those crocs can jump.
But once I get her fixed up, she's gonna be in good shape.
For what?
To get us the hell off this island.
You're going to run like a coward?
Well, I never really thought of it in those exact terms, but, generally speaking, yes.
And where will you go?
Home.
It's, you know, where I come from.
Home's not where you come from.
It's where you make it.
So help me do that.
Anyone that survived Blackbeard's attack is in the mine by now.
And I've been there, and I'm not going back.
Not for anything or anyone.
Well, if you have no reason to stay, then go.
Go now.
Leave us to die.
I don't want you to die.
I want you to come with me.
And if I don't?
Then that's your decision.
Not mine.
Well, kid.
Looks like the old gang's back together.
Let's get this ship in the air.
Let's get one thing straight.
I'm not the chosen one, and the prophecy wasn't about me if it was ever real at all.
But I am my mother's son.
And if Blackbeard is going to destroy everything my parents died for, I'll stand against him to the last.
Just like they did.
Now, take me to the fairy kingdom.
It's just as the Chief described it.
These are words.
What language is it?
Must be fairy.
I can read.
I can read it.
What does it say?
"Only the prince who bears the key shall pass. "
Just that.
Then some boring stuff about the great fallen dead.
It means we need a key.
Then this was all for nothing.
BLACKBEARD".
No, I wouldn't say that.
"The prince who bears the key. "
Don't you see, Peter?
I am the... You bear the key.
I do?
You've had it all along.
She knew I'd come for her.
Yes.
Mum tries to protect the kingdom by giving son the key.
I kill Mum, but fail to kill the son.
In turn, son fails to protect the kingdom by giving me the key.
Mum would be very disappointed.
Wouldn't she?
Eternity beckons.
I will live forever.
Wakey, wakey!
Rise and shine!
That's where we're going.
The fairy hive.
Destroy that, and we destroy them all.
Yes!
Yes!
Oh!
Come!
Come on.
Come.
Yes.
PETER".
Her name's Tinkerbell.
I can hear her.
They've been waiting for you, Peter.
You have to get away from here!
He's going to destroy you all.
I know what I was meant to do, but I failed.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry!
All right, boys, let's burn them!
Burn them!
Bum them, burn them, burn them!
Burn them all!
No!
Please, I'll do anything!
Please!
Oh, don't beg.
Anything.
No.
It's bad form to beg.
Where's your sense of honor, boy?
Now, kneel.
I said kneel!
I am the son of a warrior and a prince.
I will never bow to you.
If you're gonna kill me, then get on with it.
As you wish.
You don't have to do this.
No.
But I really want to.
Did you miss me?
Why is it always him?
Jump!
You came back!
I thought you didn't care!
Like I said, sometimes I lie.
Come on!
I can't let Blackbeard get to the hive!
Hard to port!
Mind if I cut in?
We've gotta help her!
Take the wheel!
You're gonna get this puppy as close to them as you can.
Okay!
And I'll jump across!
Hold on!
Captain!
No.
Peter, no!
No.
It's over, boy.
Come.
You!
Grab that girl!
Pan!
I can fly!
Look at me, Hook, I'm flying!
All right, you don't have to crow about it.
Whoa!
Crow all you want!
Just don't drop me!
Go on.
If we're gonna beat him, we're gonna do it together.
Do you hear me?
Good!
Now, come on, then.
Fire!
Ready?
Go!
Got you!
Think a happy thought.
BLACKBEARDI No!
Boy!
Hello A' Peter.
Peter.
Mum?
You found me.
I have your eyes.
You have my heart.
I've imagined this moment my whole life, and now...
I love you, Mum.
So much.
I don't know how you can miss someone you've never met, but I've missed you every day.
Every day?
Without you, I'm lost again.
What do I do now?
You're not lost.
You are home.
On this island, with these people.
Your people.
Your family.
You must never give up on them, as you never gave up on me.
But, Mum, I don't want to lose you again.
MARY".
You'll never lose me.
I'll always be part of this Neverland.
And a part of you.
I love you, my son.
My Peter.
My Peter Pan.
Peter.
Peter?
You thought I'd leave you here.
No, I never.
Feel like some fun?
Yes, please.
All right, gentlemen.
Hold on tight.
Peter!
You don't have a rope.
We have a lot to talk about.
I thought you were leaving.
Change of heart.
Will you take the wheel, please?
You don't want to go home?
I already am.
Is he a pirate, too?
No.
Not yet, anyway- Which way shall we go?
Set a course!
Set a course!
Hey, who's in charge here?
Well, I'm the captain.
And I'm the chosen one.
We'll have plenty of time to argue about that later, flyboy.
Suit yourself, Captain Hook.
Set a course.
Second to the right and straight on till morning.
Neverland!
Neverland!
We'll always be friends, Hook.
Won't we?
Always.
What could possibly go wrong?
The second star to the right Shines in the night for you To tell you that the dreams you plan Really can come true The second star to the right Shines with a light so rare And if it's Never Land you need Its light will lead you there Twinkle, twinkle little star So we'll know where you are Gleaming in the skies above Lead us to the land We dream of And when ourjourney is through Each time we say Good night We'll thank the little star that shines The second from The right All this has happened before.
And it will all happen again.
But this time it happened in London.
It happened on a quiet street in Bloomsbury.
That corner house over there is the home of the Darling family.
And Peter Pan chose this particular house... because there were people here who believed in him.
There was Mrs Darling.
George, dear, do hurry.
We mustn't be late for the party, you know.
Mrs Darling believed that Peter Pan was the spirit of youth.
But Mr Darling... Mary, unless I find my cuff links... we don't go to the party.
And if we don't go to the party, I can never show my face in the office again.
And if I can never... Ouch!
Well, Mr Darling was a practical man.
The boys, however, John and Michael... believed Peter Pan was a real person... and made him the hero of all their nursery games.
Blast you, Peter Pan!
Take that!
Give up, Captain Hook?
Give up?
Never!
I'll teach you to cut off me hand!
Oh, no, John.
It was the left hand.
Oh, yes.
Thank you, Wendy.
Wendy, the eldest, not only believed... she was the supreme authority on Peter Pan... and all his marvellous adventures.
Oh, Nana, must we always take that nasty tonic?
Nana, the nursemaid, being a dog... kept her opinions to herself... and viewed the whole affair with a certain tolerance.
Take that!
Insolent boy!
I'll slash you to ribbons!
And I'll cut you to pieces.
Aha!
Ouch!
Careful, Michael, my glasses.
I'm sorry, John.
You'll never leave this ship alive!
Oh, yes, I will.
Take that!
Scuttle me bones, boy, I'll slit your gizzard.
Oh, no, you won't.
Back, back, back, you villain!
Insolent pup!
Wicked pirate!
Aha, I got ya.
You didn't either.
You never touched me.
Take that and that!
And that!
Boys, boys, less noise, please.
Oh, hello, Father.
You old bilge rat.
Wh-Wh-What?
Now, see here, Michael... Oh, not you, Father.
You see, he's Peter Pan.
And John's Captain Hook.
Yes, yes, of course.
Uh, have you seen my cuff... Oh, Nana, for goodness sake!
Where are those cuff links?
Cuff links, Father?
Yes, the gold ones.
Michael, the buried treasure.
Where is it?
I don't know.
The map then.
Where's the treasure map?
It got lost.
Good heavens, my shirt front!
Hurray!
You found it!
You found it!
Yes, so I have.
And hereafter... Don't paw me, Michael.
This is my last clean... No!
No!
George, dear, we really must hurry or we'll be late... Mary, look!
George.
It's only chalk, Father.
Why, Michael.
It's not his fault.
It's in the story.
And Wendy says... Wendy?
Story?
I might have known.
Wendy!
Wendy!
Yes, Father?
Would you kindly ex... Oh, Mother!
You look simply lovely.
Thank you, dear.
Wendy.
Just my old gown made over.
But it did turn out rather nicely, didn't... Mary, if you don't mind.
I'd like... Why, Father, what have you done to your shirt?
What have I... Oh!
Now, George, really.
It comes right off.
That's no excuse.
Wendy, haven't I warned you?
Stuffing the boys' heads with a lot of silly stories.
Oh, but they aren't.
I say they are.
Captain Crook!
Peter Pirate!
Peter Pan, Father.
Pan!
Pirate!
Poppycock!
Oh, no, Father.
Father, have you... Oh, you don't understand.
Absolute poppycock!
And let me tell you, this ridiculous... Now, George.
"Now, George."
"Now, George"!
Well, "Now, George," will have his say!
Please, dear.
Mary, the child's growing up.
It's high time she had a room of her own.
Father!
George!
What?
No!
I mean it!
Young lady, this is your last night in the nursery.
And that's my last word on the matter... No!
No!
Oh!
Poor Nana.
"Poor Nana"?
This is the last straw!
Out!
Out, I say!
No, Father, no!
Yes!
There'll be no more dogs for nursemaids in this house!
Goodbye, Nana.
"Poor Nana."
Oh, yes, "Poor Nana."
But "Poor Father"?
Oh, no!
Blast it!
Where is that rope?
Oh, thank you.
Dash it all, Nana, don't look at me like that.
It's nothing personal.
It's just that... Well, you're not really a nurse at all.
You're, well, a dog.
And the children aren't puppies.
They're people.
And sooner or later, Nana, people have to grow up.
But, Mother, I don't want to grow up.
Now, dear, don't worry about it any more tonight.
He called Peter Pan "absolute poppycock."
I'm sure he didn't mean it, John.
Father was just upset.
Poor Nana, out there all alone.
No more tears, Michael.
It's a warm night.
She'll be all right.
Mother.
What is it, dear?
Buried treasure.
Now, children.
Don't judge your father too harshly.
After all, he really loves you very much.
Oh, don't lock it, Mother.
He might come back.
"He"?
Yes, uh, Peter Pan.
You see, I found something that belongs to him.
Oh?
And what's that?
His shadow.
"Shadow"?
Mmm, Nana had it.
But I...
I took it away.
Oh?
Yes, of course.
Good night, dear.
But, George, do you think the children will be safe without Nana?
Safe?
Of course they'll be safe.
Why not?
Well, Wendy said something about a shadow, and I...
Shadow?
Whose shadow?
Peter Pan's.
Oh, Peter Pan... Peter Pan!
You don't say.
Goodness gracious, whatever shall we do?
But, George... Really, I... Sound the alarm!
Call Scotland Yard!
There must have been someone.
Oh, Mary, of all the impossible, childish fiddle-faddle.
Peter Pan indeed.
How can we expect the children to grow up and be practical... George, dear.
When you're as bad as they are.
Please.
No wonder Wendy gets these idiotic ideas.
Over there, Tink, in its den.
Is it there?
Must be here somewhere.
Tink!
Shh!
Stop playing and help me find my shadow.
Shadow.
Oh, shadow.
Huh?
Aha!
Peter Pan!
Oh, Peter!
I knew you'd come back.
I saved your shadow for you.
Oh, I do hope it isn't rumpled.
You know, you look exactly the way I thought you would.
Oh, a little taller perhaps.
But then... Oh, you can't stick it on with soap, Peter.
It needs sewing.
That's the proper way to do it.
Although, come to think of it, I've never thought about it before.
Uh, sewing shadows, I mean.
Of course, I knew it was your shadow the minute I saw it.
And I said to myself, I said, "I'll put it away for him until he comes back.
Oh, he's sure to come back."
And you did, didn't you, Peter?
After all, one can't leave his shadow lying about and not miss it sooner or later.
Uh, don't you agree?
But what I still don't understand is how Nana got it in the first place.
She really isn't... Oh, sit down.
It won't take long.
She really isn't vicious, you know.
She's a wonderful nurse.
Although Father says...
Girls talk too much.
Yes, girls talk too... Hmm?
Oh.
Well, get on with it, girl.
Uh, my name is Wendy.
Uh, Wendy Moira Angela Darl... Wendy's enough.
Oh, uh, but how did Nana get your shadow, Peter?
Jumped at me the other night at the window.
Well, what were you doing there?
I came to listen to the stories.
My stories?
But they're all about you.
Of course.
That's why I like 'em.
I tell 'em to the Lost Boys.
The Lost Boys... Oh, I remember.
They're your men.
Uh-huh.
I'm so glad you came back tonight.
I might never have seen you.
Why?
Because I have to grow up tomorrow.
Grow up!
Tonight's my last night in the nursery.
But that means no more stories.
Mm-hmm.
No!
I won't have it.
Come on!
Bu-Bu-But where are we going?
To Never Land.
Never Land!
You'll never grow up there.
Oh, Peter, it will be so wonderful.
But wait.
What would Mother say?
Mother?
What's Mother?
Why, Peter, a mother is someone who... who loves and cares for you.
And... And tells you stories... Good!
You can be our mother.
Come on.
Now, just a minute, I... Let me see now.
L-I have to pack.
Oh, and I must leave a note when I'll be back.
Of course, I couldn't stay too long.
And then I'll have to... Oh, but Never Land.
Oh, I... I-I'm so happy I...
I think I'll give you a... a kiss.
What's a... a kiss?
Oh, well, uh, I-I'll show you.
Oh!
Stop!
Stop it, Tink!
John, John, wake up!
He's here.
Huh?
Jiminy!
Ooh, what in the world was that?
Tinker Bell.
Don't know what got into her.
Hello, Peter Pan.
I'm Michael.
And my name is John.
How do you do?
Hello.
Oh, look, a firefly.
A pixie.
Amazing!
What's the pixie doing?
Talking.
What did she say?
She says you're a big, ugly girl.
Oh.
Well, I think she's lovely.
Well, come on, Wendy, let's go.
Where are we going?
To Never Land.
Never Land!
Peter's taking us.
"Us"?
Well, of course.
L-I couldn't go without Michael and John.
Oh, I should like very much to cross swords with some real buccaneers.
Yes, and fight pirates too.
Well, all right, but ya gotta take orders.
Aye, aye, sir.
Me too.
But, Peter, how do we get to Never Land?
Fly, of course.
"Fly"?
It's easy.
All you have to do is to... is to... Is to... Ha!
That's funny.
What's the matter?
Don't you know?
Oh, sure.
It's...
It's just that I never thought about it before.
Say, that's it!
You think of a wonderful thought.
Any happy, little thought?
Uh-huh.
Like toys at Christmas?
Sleigh bells, snow?
Yep!
Watch me now.
Here I go!
It's easier than pie.
He can fly!
He can fly!
He flewed!
Now you try.
I'll think of a mermaid lagoon... underneath a magic moon.
I'll think I'm in a pirate's cave.
I think I'll be an Indian brave.
Now everybody try.
One, two, three!
We can fly!
We can fly!
We can fly!
This won't do.
What's the matter with you?
All it takes is faith and trust.
Oh!
And something I forgot.
Dust!
Dust?
Dust?
Yep, just a little bit of pixie dust.
Now, think of the happiest things.
It's the same as having wings.
Let's all try it just once more.
Look!
We're rising off the floor.
Jiminy!
Oh, my!
We can fly!
You can fly!
We can fly!
Come on, everybody.
Here we go!
Off to Never Land!
Think of a wonderful thought Any merry little thought Think of Christmas Think of snow Think of sleigh bells Off you go like reindeer in the sky You can fly, you can fly You can fly Think of the happiest things It's the same as having wings Take the path that moonbeams make If the moon is still awake you'll see him wink his eye You can fly, you can fly You can fly Up you go with a heigh and ho To the stars beyond the blue There's a Never Land waiting for you Where all your happy dreams come true Every dream that you dream will come true Come on, Nana!
When there's a smile in your heart There's no better time to start Think of all thejoy you'll find When you leave the world behind and bid your cares goodbye You can fly, you can fly You can fly, you can fly You can fly There it is, Wendy.
Second star to the right and straight on till morning.
When there's a smile in your heart There's no better time to start Think of all thejoy you'll find when you leave the world behind And bid your cares goodbye You can fly, you can fly You can fly, you can fly You can fly You can fly, you can fly You can fly Oh, a pirate's life is a wonderful life A- rovin'over the sea Give me a career as a buccaneer It's the life of a pirate for me, oh The life of a pirate for me Oh, a pirate's life is a wonderful life They never bury your bones For when it's all over a jolly sea rover drops in on his friend, Davy Jones Oh, my good friend Davy Jones Good morning, shipmates.
And what's good about it, Mr Smee?
Here we are, collecting barnacles on this miserable island.
While his nibs plays ring-around-the-rosy with Peter Pan.
Look out.
It might go off.
We ought to be tending to the business of looting ships.
Why, I've almost forgotten how to slit a throat.
Better hop it.
And tell the captain... we wants to put to sea, see?
Peter Pan...
Blast that Peter Pan!
If I could only find his hideout, I'd trap him in his lair.
But where is it?
Mermaid Lagoon?
No, we've searched that.
We've combed Cannibal Cove.
H-Here!
No.
No, no, no!
That's Indian terri...
But wait.
Those redskins know this island better than I do me own ship.
Ah...
I wonder.
Good morning, Captain.
I've got it!
Tiger Lily, Smee!
T-Tiger Lily, Captain?
The Chief's daughter.
She'll know where Pan is hiding.
B-B-But, but will she talk, Captain?
Oh, a little persuasion might be in order.
Now let me see.
Boiling in oil?
Keelhauling?
Marooning?
A pirate's life is a wonderful I-life You'll find adventure and sport But live every minute for all that is in it The life of a pirate is short Oh, the life... Now let me see, where was I?
Oh, dear, dear, dear Captain Hook.
Shooting a man in the middle of his cadenza?
It ain't good form, you know.
"Good form," Mr Smee?
Blast good form!
Did Pan show good form when he did this to me?
Why, Captain, cutting your hand off was only a childish prank, you might say.
Aye!
But throwing it to the crocodile!
That cursed beast liked the taste of me so well... he's followed me ever since, licking his chops... for the rest of me.
And he'd have had you by now, Captain... if he hadn't swallowed that alarm clock.
But now when he's about, he warns ya as ya might say with his tick-tock... tick-tock, tick-tock.
Smee?
Smee!
Oh, save me, Smee!
Please, don't let him get me, Smee!
Please, don't let him get me, Smee!
Smee!
Here now, shame on ya.
Upsettin' the poor Captain.
There'll be no handouts today.
Shoo now, shoo!
Go on, go on, off it.
Off with ya, I say, go away, go away, out of here.
Is he gone, Smee?
Aye, Captain, all clear.
Nothin' to worry about.
Oh, Smee, Smee.
I can't stand it any longer.
I tell you, I can't.
Now, now, now, now, Captain.
Just relax.
What you need is a shave.
A nice soothing shave.
There now.
Oh, a pirate's life is a wonderful life A- sailing over the sea Give me a career as a... Captain, you know, I can't help noticin'... you just ain't been your usual jolly self of late.
Give me a career as a buccaneer And the crew's gettin' a might uneasy, Captain.
That is, what's left of it.
Now, why don't we put to sea, see?
Leave Never Land.
Forget Peter Pan.
There now!
Give me a career as a buccaneer We'd all be a lot happier, not to mention a lot healthier.
Captain?
Oh, dear!
I never shaved him this close before.
Now, don't worry, Captain.
L-It must be somewhere about.
Get up, you idiot!
Aye, aye, sir.
Ooh!
I found it, Captain.
Good as new.
Why, you blithering blockhead!
Peter Pan ahoy!
What?
What?
Where away?
Three points off the starboard bow!
Swoggle me eyes!
It is Pan!
Headed this way with some more of those scurvy brats!
Mr Smee, pipe up the crew!
A-Aye, aye, sir.
Uh, pipe up the crew.
Uh, pipe up the crew.
All hands on deck!
All hands on deck!
All hands on deck!
All hands on deck!
Look alive, you swabs!
We've got him this time, Mr Smee.
That we have, Captain.
Man the Long Tom, you bilge rats!
I've waited years for this.
That's not countin' the holidays either.
Double the powder and shorten the fuse!
Shorten the powder and double the fuse!
A pretty sight, Mr Smee.
We'll pot 'em like sitting ducks.
All right, men!
Range 42.
"Range 42."
Elevation 65.
"Elevation 65."
Three degrees west.
"Three degrees west."
Steady now!
Steady!
Oh, Peter, it's just as I've always dreamed it would be.
Oh, look, John, there's Mermaid Lagoon.
By Jove!
And the Indian encampment!
Oh, look, there's Captain Hook and the pirates.
Look out!
Quick, Tink, take Wendy and the boys to the island.
I'll stay here and draw Hook's fire.
Hook!
Hook!
You codfish!
Here!
Tinker Bell?
Not so fast.
Please, Tinker Bell.
We can't keep up with you.
Tinker Bell!
Wait!
Ouch!
So!
Who ya shovin'?
Who ya shovin'?
You!
That's who!
I'll show you!
Huh?
Orders from Pan?
Hold it, men!
What's the orders, Tink?
A terrible what?

"Wendy Bird"?
Flying this way?
Uh, Pan's orders are... What?
Smash it?
Kick it?
Stomp it?
Stomp it?
Oh!
Shoot it down!
Shoot it down!
Yeah!
Yeah, shoot it down!
Come on, follow Tink!
Follow Tink!
Let's go!
Yeah, come on.
Let's go then!
We're gonna get 'er!
I see it!
Me too!
Me too!
Ready, aim... fire!
Oh, Peter, you saved my life.
Are you hurted, Wendy?
No, Michael.
Good heavens, Wendy, you might have been killed.
Hey!
Hey!
Pan!
We followed your orders, Pan!
Hey, Pan, I got it with my skull buster!
Ya did not!
We did!
I did it, Pan!
I did it!
No, I did!
Attention!
Well...
I'm certainly proud of you, you blockheads!
I bring ya a mother to tell ya stories... A mother?
And you shoot her down.
Well, Tink said it was a bird!
Tink said what?
Well, she said you said to shoot it down!
Tinker Bell.
Tink!
Come here.
You're charged with high treason, Tink.
Are you guilty or not guilty?
Guilty?
But don't ya know ya might have killed her?
Tinker Bell!
I hereby banish you forever.
Please, not forever.
Well, for a week then.
Come on, Wendy, I'll show you the island.
Oh, Peter, uh, the mermaids?
Aw, let's go huntin'!
Tigers?
Naw, bears.
Naw, bears.
Personally, I should prefer to see the aborigines.
And the Indians too.
All right, men!
Go out and capture a few Indians.
John, you be the leader.
I shall try to be worthy of my post.
Forward!
March!
Come on, bear.
Oh, Michael, do be careful.
Come on, Wendy.
I'll show you the mermaids.

Quite savage, you know.
Uh, let's go get 'em.
Come on!
We'll get 'em!
Gentlemen, gentlemen.
First, we must plan our strategy.
Uh, what's strategy?
A plan of attack.
The initial phase is an encircling manoeuvre, thus!
John!
Indians!
Indians!
Let me in!
Now remember, the Indian is cunning... Hey... but not intelligent.
Therefore, we simply surround them and take them by surprise...
I'm frightfully sorry, old chaps.
It's all my fault.
Aw, that's all right, Wildcat.
Oh, we don't mind.
That's okay.
How!
Uh, h-how, Chief!
How!
For many moons red man fight paleface Lost Boys.
Ugh.
Ugh, ugh.
Sometime you win.
Sometime we win.
Okay, Chief.
Uh, you win this time.
Now, turn us loose.
"Turn us loose"?
You mean this is only a game?
Sure!
When we win, we turn them loose.
When they win, they turn us loose.
They turn us loose.
This time, no turn 'em loose.
Huh?
Huh?
The Chief's a great spoofer.
Me no spoof'em.
Where you hide Princess Tiger Lily?
Uh, Tiger Lily?
We ain't got your old princess.
I've certainly never seen her.
Me neither.
Honest we don't.
Heap big lie.
If Tiger Lily not back by sunset... burn 'em at stake.
Just imagine, real live mermaids.
Would you like to meet 'em?
Oh, Peter, I'd love to.
All right, come on.
It's Peter.
Oh!
Hello, Peter!
Hello, Peter!
Hello, Peter!
Hello!
Hello, Peter!
Hello, girls.
I'm so glad to see you.
Why did you stay away so long?
Did you miss me?
Tell us one of your adventures.
Something exciting.
Want to hear about the time I cut off Hook's hand and threw it to the crocodile?
Oh, I've always liked that one.
Me too.
Well, there I was on Marooner's Rock surrounded... Oh, Peter!
By 40 or Huh?
Her?
Oh, that's Wendy.
A girl?
What's she doing here?
And in her nightdress too.
Come on, dearie.
Join us for a swim.
Oh, please, I'm not dressed for it.
Oh, but you must!
We insist!
No, no, please!
Too good for us, eh?
Peter!
If you dare to come near me again... Wendy!
Wendy!
They were just having a little fun, weren't you, girls?
That's all.
We were only trying to drown her.
Ya see?
Well, if you think for one minute... that I'm going to put up with a... Shh.
Hold it, Wendy.
Yep, it's Hook, all right.
Hook!
Hook!
Hook!
Oh!
Quick, Wendy.
They've captured Tiger Lily.
Looks like they're headin' for Skull Rock.
Come on, Wendy.
Let's see what they're up to.
Now, me dear Princess, this is me proposition.
You tell me the hiding place of Peter Pan... and I shall set you free.
You dog.
Poor Tiger Lily.
Am I not a man of me word, Mr Smee?
Oh, yes, always, Captain.
You'd better talk, me dear, for soon the tide will be in... and then it will be too late.
I'll show the old codfish.
Stay here, Wendy, and watch the fun.
"Fun"?
Remember... there is no path through water... to the happy hunting ground.
This is your last chance, Tiger Lily!
Manatoa, great spirit of mighty seawater, speak!
Beware, Captain Hook!
Beware!
Beware!
Did you hear that, Smee?
It's an evil spirit, Captain.
Stand by, Smee, while I take a look around.
Spirit of the great seawater, is it?
Psst!
Wendy.
Watch this.
Mr Smee!
Uh, yes, Captain?
Release the princess and take her back to her people.
Aye, aye, sir.
Release the princess...
But...
But, Captain... Those are me orders, Mr Smee!
Aye, aye, sir.
Well, at last Captain Hook's comin' to his senses.
Odd's fish!
I told him all along you Indians wouldn't betray Peter Pan.
And just what do you think you are doing, Mr Smee?
Just what you told me, Captain.
Carryin' out your orders.
My orders?
Why, yes, Captain.
Didn't you just say to go...
Put her back!
You blithering idiot!
My orders.
Of all the bumbling... Mr Smee!
Just exactly what do you think you are doing?
Putting her back like you said, Captain.
I said nothing of the sort!
Oh, but, C-Captain, d-d-didn't you?
I thought that... For the last time, Mr Smee.
Take the princess back to her people.
Understand?
Understand?
Understand?
Understand?
Uh, aye, aye, sir.
Oh, and one more thing.
When you return to the ship, tell the whole crew... to help themselves to me best rum.
Peter!
Here's your spirit, Smee!
Why, it's Peter Pan.
Scurvy brat!
Thank you, Captain.
Come down, boy, if you've a taste for cold steel.
Watch this, Wendy.
Oh, Peter, do be careful.
Try your luck, Mr Smee?
Let him have it!
Well, come on, you idiot!
Blast him!
Right here, Mr Smee.
Hold it, you fool!
No!
No!
Captain?
Oh, how dreadful.
What a pity, Mr Smee.
I'm afraid we've lost the dear Captain.
Captain!
In the back, Captain?
Give it to him, Captain!
Cleave him to the brisket.
I've got you this time, Pan.
Well, well, a codfish on a hook.
I'll get you for this, Pan, if it's the last thing I do!
I say, Captain, do you hear something?
No.
No!
No!
Mr Crocodile, do you like codfish?
You do?
Oh, Peter, no!
No!
Smee!
D-Don't go away, Captain!
Uh, stay right there now, sir.
I'll save ya, sir.
Smee!
Smee!
Smee!
Ow!
Captain!
Captain!
Smee!
Smee!
Give him back!
Smee... Row for the ship!
Row for the ship... Whoa!
Smee!
Peter, what about Tiger Lily?
Tiger Lily?
Oh, Tiger Lily.
Help... Peter.
Wait for me.
That cursed Peter Pan.
Making a fool out of me.
Oh, my head.
Oh, a pirate's life is a wonderful life Your hot water, Mr Smee.
Shh!
The poor Captain has a splitting headache.
We mustn't annoy him.
Well, Captain, it's nice to see you smiling again.
Brings back the good old days when we was leadin' a healthy, normal life.
Scuttlin' ships, cuttin' throats.
Oh, Captain... why don't we put to sea again?
You know, there's trouble brewin' on the island.
Women trouble.
I wouldn't want this to go any farther, but... the cook told me that the first mate told him... that he heard that Pan has banished Tinker Bell.
Whoa!
Why, you doddering imbecile, I... Did you say Pan... has banished Tinker Bell?
Aye, aye, Captain.
That he has.
But why?
Well, on account of Wendy, Captain.
Tink tried to do her in, she did.
Tink's terrible jealous.
Well, well.
That's why we ought to leave, Captain.
This ain't no place for a respectable pirate.
That's it, Smee!
That's it!
I'm glad you agrees, Captain.
Quick, me coat.
Me best dress coat.
Aye, aye, sir.
The sooner we get going, the better.
Ah, yes, a jealous female can be tricked into anything.
My case of hooks!
Aye, aye, sir.
Here you are, sir.
Your Sunday set, sir.
If we impress the pixie, convince her we're eager to help her... the wench may chart our course to a... certain hiding place.
Our best hiding place is the Spanish main, sir.
I'll set our course... And where do you think you are going?
T-To tell the boys we sails with the tide, sir.
You will go ashore, pick up Tinker Bell... and bring her to me.
Understand?
Aye, aye, s-s-s-sir.
How!
How!
What's the Chief doing, John?
He's delivering an oration in sign language.
What's he saying?
He says... "Peter Pan, mighty warrior.
"Save Tiger Lily.
Make big Chief heap glad."
Well, he certainly doesn't look "heap glad."
Make Peter Pan heap big chief.
You now Little Flying Eagle.
Hurray for Flying Eagle!
Flying Eagle!
Hurray!
Hurray!
Oh, how wonderful!
Hurray!
Teach 'em paleface brother all about red man.
Good, this should be most enlightening.
Uh, what makes the red man red?
When did he first say, "Ugh"?
First say, "Ugh"?
Why does he ask you, "How"?
"Why does he ask you, 'How'?"

Squaw no get 'em firewood!
Squaw go home.
Beggin' your pardon, Miss Bell... but Captain Hook would like a word with ya.
Yes, Miss Bell, Captain Hook admits defeat.
Tomorrow I leave the island, never to return.
I'm glad to hear that, Captain.
I'll tell the crew and... And that's why I asked you over, me dear... to tell Peter I bear him no ill will.
Oh, Pan has his faults, to be sure.
Uh, bringing that Wendy to the island, for instance.
Dangerous business, that.
Why, rumour has it that already she has come between you and Peter.
But what's this?
Tears?
Then it is true.
Oh, Smee.
The way of a man with a maid.
Taking the best years of her life and then... casting her aside like an old glove!
Ain't it a bloomin' shame?
But we mustn't judge Peter too harshly, me dear.
It's that Wendy who's to blame.
Mr Smee, we must save the lad from himself.
But how?
We've so little time.
We sail in the morning.
Sail!
That's it, Smee!
We'll shanghai Wendy.
"Shanghai Wendy," Captain?
Take her to sea with us.
With her gone, Peter will soon forget this mad infatuation.
Come, Smee, we must leave immediately.
Surround Peter's home...
But, Captain, we... we don't know where Peter Pan lives!
Great Scott, you're right, Smee!
What's that, my dear?
You could show us the way?
Why, I never thought of that.
Take this down, Smee.
"Take this down, Smee."
Aye, aye, Captain.
Start at Pegleg Point.
"Start at Pegleg Point."
Forty paces west of Blindman's Bluff.
"Blindman's Bluff."
Yes, yes.
Hop, skip and a jump across Crocodile Creek.
Then north by northeast, one, two, three.
Well, get on with it... Continue, my dear.
I mustn't harm Peter?
Madam, Captain Hook gives his word... not to lay a finger... or a hook on Peter Pan.
Ah, Hangman's Tree.
So that's the entrance to his hiding place.
Thank you, me dear.
You've been most helpful.

Big Chief greets Little Mother.
How!
Ugh!
Aw, Wendy, is that all you have to say?
Everyone else thinks I'm wonderful.
Especially Tiger Lily.
Tiger Lily?
John!
Michael!
Take off that war paint and get ready for bed.
Bed?
Brave no sleep.
Go for days without sleep.
But, boys, we're going home in the morning.
Home!
And... Oh, Wendy, we don't want to go home.
No go home.
Stay many moons.
Have heap big time.
Now, Peter, let's stop pretending and be practical.
Chief Flying Eagle has spoken.
Oh, for goodness sake.
Please, boys.
Do you want to stay here and grow up like... like savages?
Of course.
But you can't.
You need a mother.
We all do.
Aren't you our mother, Wendy?
Why, Michael, of course not!
Surely you haven't forgotten our real mother!
Did she have silky ears and wear a fur coat?
Oh, no, Michael.
That was Nana.
I think I had a mother once.
What was she like?
What was she like?
I forget.
I had a white rat!
That's no mother!
Hey, who ya shovin'?
No, no, boys!
Please.
I'll tell you what a mother is.
Yeah, tell us.
Yeah, tell us.
Please, Wendy.
Well, a mother, a real mother... is the most wonderful person in the world.
She's the angel voice... that bids you good night... kisses your cheek... whispers, "Sleep tight."
Your mother And mine Your mother And mine The helping hand that guides you along Whether you're right Whether you're wrong Your mother And mine Your mother And mine What makes mothers all that they are Might as well ask what makes a star Ask your heart to tell you her worth Your heart will say Heaven on earth Another word Shh.
For divine Your mother And mine I wanna see my mother.
Yes, Michael.
I propose we leave for home at once.
Could I go too?
Huh, Wendy?
Me too, Wendy!
Come on!
Let me go!
All right, boys.
All right.
I'm sure Mother would be glad to have you.
Uh, that is, if Peter doesn't mind.
Go on!
Go back and grow up!
But I'm warning ya.
Once you're grown up... you can never come back!
Never!
Dear.
Well, then, shall we be off?
Yeah, come on.
Let's go!
Yeah!
See ya, Peter.
They'll be back.
Peter.
Goodbye, Peter.
All right, men.
Take them away.
And now, Smee, to take care of Master Peter Pan.
But, Captain, wouldn't it be more humane-like to slit his throat?
Aye, that it would, Mr Smee.
But I have given me word not to lay a finger... or a hook on Peter Pan.
And Captain Hook never breaks a promise.
Yo ho, yo ho Yo ho, yo ho, yo ho So try the life of a thief Just sample the life of a crook There isn't a boy who won't enjoy A- workin'for Captain Hook The world's most famous crook Crook, crook, crickety crockety, crickety, crick the croc is after Captain...

Please!
Oh, boy!
I wanna be a pirate!
Oh, boy!
A pirate!
Boys!
Aren't you ashamed of yourselves?
But Captain Hook is most insistent, Wendy.
Yeah!
He says we'll walk the plank if we don't.
Oh, no, we won't.
Peter Pan will save us.
Peter Pan will save them, Smee.
Peter Pan will save them.
Oh, Captain, you did it.
But a thousand pardons, my dear.
I don't believe you are in on our little joke.
You see, we left a present for Peter.
Sort of a surprise package, you might say.
Why, I can see our little friend at this very moment... reading the tender inscription.
"To Peter, with love from Wendy.
Do not open till 6 o'clock."
Huh.
I wonder what's in it.
Could he but see within the package... he would find an ingenious little device.
Set, so that when the clock is like this... Peter Pan will be blasted... out of Never Land forever.
No!
But time grows short.
We have but 18 seconds.
Fifteen seconds.
Thirteen seconds.
Twelve seconds.
Well, I guess I can open it now.
Hey, Tink.
Look what Wendy left.
Hey, stop that!
Stop it!
What's the matter with you?
Hook?
A bomb?
Don't be ridiculous!
And so passeth a worthy opponent.
Amen.
Hook!
It was a bomb!
Why, if it hadn't been for Tink... Tinker Bell!
Tink?
Tinker Bell?
Where are you, Tink?
Tink?
Tinker Bell!
Tink.
Are you all right?
Wendy?
The boys?
But I've gotta save you first.
Hold on, Tink!
Hold on!
Don't go out.
Don't you understand, Tink?
You mean more to me than anything in this whole world!
And now, which will it be?
The pen or the plank?
Captain Hook, we will never join your crew.
As you wish.
Ladies first, my dear.
Goodbye, boys.
Goodbye, Wendy.
Goodbye, Wendy.
Be brave, John.
I shall strive to, Wendy.
Goodbye, Michael.
Goodbye, Wendy.
Come on!
Get along over there!
Get going, miss.
Get going!
Don't give us no trouble!
Go on!
Go on!
Get it over with!
Move along!
The Captain's waitin'!
Wendy!
Wendy!
Captain, n-no splash.
Not a sound.
Not a bloomin' ripple.
It's a jinx, that's what it is.
No splash.
No sign of the wench.
Did you hear a splash?
I'm telling you, mates, it's a black day.
Mark me words.
We'll all pay for this.
The ship is bewitched.
No splash, Captain.
So, you want a splash, Mr Starkey.
I'll give you a splash!
Who's next?
You're next, Hook!
This time you've gone too far!
It's Pan!
Peter Pan!
And Wendy!
It can't be!
It's his blinkin' ghost what's talkin'!
Say your prayers, Hook.
I'll show you this ghost has blood in his veins.
I'll run him through!
Ooh!
Take that!
Curse this hook!
Come on, everybody!
Hurry, Michael!
Hurry!
Don't stand there, you bilge rats!
Get those scurvy brats!
After the brats, men!
This is no mere boy.
'Tis some fiend fighting me.
A flying devil!
Hold your fire.
Get 'em!
Steady, men.
Steady.
Club 'em with the marline.
Fire!
I'll crack their bloomin' skulls!
Let me at 'em!
Down, you blackguard!
Hurray!
Right through, Michael.
Yea, Bear Killer!
Yea for Bear Killer!
Fly!
Fly!
Fly!
You coward!
Coward?
Me?
Ha-ha-ha!
You wouldn't dare fight old Hook man-to-man!
You'd fly away like a cowardly sparrow!
Nobody calls Pan a coward and lives!
I'll fight you man-to-man, with one hand behind my back.
You mean you won't fly?
No, don't, Peter!
It's a trick!
I give my word, Hook.
Good, then let's have at it!
Now!
Insolent youth, prepare to die!
Fly!
Fly, Peter!
Fly!
No!
I gave my word.
You're mine, Hook!
Cleave him to the brisket!
You wouldn't do old Hook in now, would you, lad?
I'll go away forever.
I'll do anything you say.
Well, all right.
If ya say you're a codfish.
I'm a codfish.
Louder!
I'm a codfish!
Hurray!
Hook is a codfish A codfish, a codfish Hook is a codfish, a codfish, a codfish All right, Hook... you're free to go, and never return.
Peter!
Smee!
Smee!
Smee!
Smee!
Smee!
Smee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee!
Captain!
Captain!
Captain!
Hurray!
Hurray for Captain Pan!
All right, ya swabs, aloft with ya!
We're castin' off!
Heave those halyards!
But, but, Peter... Oh, that is, Captain Pan.
At your service, madam.
Could you tell me, sir, where we're sailing?
To London, madam.
Oh, Peter.
Michael!
John!
We're going home!
Man the capstan!
Hoist anchor!
Pixie dust!
George, I am so glad you changed your mind about Wendy.
After all, she's still a child.
Oh, pshaw, Mary.
You know I never mean those things.
Do I, Nana?
Oh!
Wendy!
Wendy, what on earth are you doing there?
Mmm.
Hmm?
Oh, Mother, we're back!
Back?
All except the Lost Boys.
They weren't quite ready.
Lost Bo... Ready?
To grow up.
That's why they went back to Never Land.
Never Land?
Yes, but I am.
Uh, "am"?
Uh, ready to grow up.
Oh!
Oh!
Uh... Well, my dear, all in good time.
After all, perhaps we were too... Oh, but, Mother... it was such a wonderful adventure.
Tinker Bell and the mermaids and Peter Pan.
Oh, he was the most wonderful of all.
Why, why, even when we were kidnapped, I... Kidnapped!
Mm-hmm.
I knew Peter Pan would save us, and he did.
And we all called him a codfish!
Uh, Captain Hook, I mean.
And then we sailed away on a ship in the sky.
Hmm.
Mary, I'm going to bed.
Oh, Mother.
He really is wonderful, isn't he?
See how well he sails the ship.
George.
George!
Now what, Mary?
Nana, d-did you see... You know, I have the strangest feeling... that I've seen that ship before.
A long time ago... when I was very young.
George, dear.
Father.
When there's a smile in your heart There's no better time to start Think of all thejoy you'll find When you leave the world behind And bid your cares goodbye You can fly You can fly You can fly
Cinderella flew through the air... far from all things ugly and ordinary.
When she landed at the ball, she found herself... most impertinently surrounded by pirates.
There was Alf Mason, so ugly his mother sold him for a bottle of muscat.
Bill Jukes, every inch ofhim tattooed.
And worst of them all, Hook, with eyes blue as forget-me-nots, save when he clawed your belly with the iron hook he has... instead of a right hand, at which time... his eyes turn red.
"Girlie," said Hook, "we have come for ye glass slippers."
Who be you to order me about and call me girlie?
Take that.!
Take that!
Take that!
Commoner.!
-Hook came at her.
What happened then?
What happened then?
The brave Cinderella settled the matter once and for all... with her revolver.
With her revolver?
The night on which the extraordinary adventures... of these children may be said to have begun... was the night Nana barked at the window.
But there was nothing there, not a bird or a leaf.
So the children forgot about it, for what troubles a grown-up will never trouble a child.
Oh, dearest George, dear Mary.
Oh, what a journey I've had.
Bath time.
Not fair!
Not fair, indeed.
But Nana was the finest nurse on four paws.
No.
No, I will not forgive you.
There never was a happier, simpler family.
Mr.
Darling was a banker who knew the cost of everything, even a hug.
Mrs.
Darling was the loveliest lady in Bloomsbury... with a sweet, mocking mouth that had one kiss on it... that Wendy could never get.
Though there it was, perfectly conspicuous on the right-hand corner.
And sometimes there was Aunt Millicent... who felt a dog for a nurse lowered the whole tone of the neighborhood.
All right, all right, all right, all right.
Less noise.
Let's settle down.
This is not a farm.
Bravo, George.
Bravo.
Wendy's turn.
Wendy must tell a story.
Cecco, who carved his name on the governor at Goa.
Noodler, with his hands on backwards.
Heavens.
Hook!
Hook?
Hook, whose eyes turn red as he guts you.
Upon my soul, how children are educated nowadays.
I'm afraid I am not learned at all, Aunt.
But I do know a thing or two about pirates.
Ooh.
My unfulfilled ambition is to write a great novel in three parts about my adventures.
What adventures?
I've yet to have them, but they will be perfectly thrilling.
But, child, novelists are not highly thought of in good society.
And there is nothing so difficult to marry as a novelist.
Marry?
Marry?
Marry?
But, Aunt, Wendy is not yet 13.
Walk toward me, dear, that I may appraise you.
Go on.
Walk to your auntie.
Stand up straight.
Stop it!
Turn around.
Shh.
Mm, yes.
Oh, it's quite as I expected.
Wendy possesses a woman's chin.
Have you not noticed?
Observe her mouth.
There, hidden in the right-hand corner, is that a kiss?
A kiss?
Like Mother's kiss.
A hidden kiss.
But what is it for?
It is for the greatest adventure of all.
They that find it... have slipped in and out of heaven.
Find what?
The one the kiss belongs to.
My Wendy... a woman.
Almost a woman.
She must spend less time with her brothers... and more time with me.
She must have her own room.
Ayoung lady's room.
Leave the... George, the daughter of a clerk cannot hope to marry as well as that of a manager.
You must attend more parties, make small talk with your superiors at the bank.
Wit is very fashionable at the moment.
Wit.
But there was no sign of a body, for none had fallen.
Certainly she had been dreaming.
If this is you in bed, what is this?
A boy.
Miss Fulsom dispatched a letter of outrage to Mr.
Darling... that set new standards of prudery, even for her.
Yes, miss.
Mr.
Darling had been practicing small talk all afternoon.
I say, it's nice weather we're having.
And now his opportunity had arrived.
Sir Edward Quiller Couch, the president of the bank, was a man who enjoyed small talk... almost as much as a good balance sheet.
Wendy walked as one condemned.
And then... fate.
The letter!
Wait!
Stop!
Wendy, wait!
Come back!
I say, what a splendid tie.
Wait.!
You there.!
Stop.!
Wendy.!
Nana, come back.!
That's 200 saved.
Ajudicious investment?
Indeed.
Uh... Hi.
Um...
I, uh... You there, stop.!
Wait.!
Stop!
Wait!
Uh, uh, uh...
I, uh...
I can explain.!
No!
I have been humiliated.!
No!
I must become a man that children fear and adults respect, or we shall all end up in the street!
George, not so loud.
The neighbors will hear.
Let them hear.
Let the whole world know!
This is not a nurse!
This is a dog.
Tomorrow you begin your instruction... with Aunt Millicent.
It's time for you to grow up.!
Mother?
Can anything harm us after the night-lights are lit?
No, precious.
They are the eyes a mother leaves behind to guard her children.
Mother, must you go to the party?
Please, Mother.
Yes, Mother, you don't have to go.
Father can go by himself.
Please, Mother.
By himself?
Your father is a brave man.
But he's going to need the special kiss to face his colleagues tonight.
Father?
Brave?
There are many different kinds of bravery.
There's the bravery of thinking of others before oneself.
Now, your father has never brandished a sword nor fired a pistol, thank heavens.
But he's made many sacrifices for his family... and put away many dreams.
Where did he put them?
He put them in a drawer.
And sometimes, late at night, we take them out and admire them.
But it gets harder and harder to close the drawer.
He does.
And that is why he is brave.
And remember, every cloud has a silver lining.
Oh.
Oh.
No, it's snowing.
Oh, we'll catch our death.
Better death than gossip.
You will enter that drawing room with your head held high.
Oh!
Shh!
One, two, Three!
Aha!
Come here, you!
I got you.
Ha!
Boy, why are you crying?
You can fly!
What is your name?
What is your name?
Wendy Moira Angela Darling.
Peter... Pan.
Where do you live?
Second to the right and then straight on till morning.
They put that on the letters?
Don't get any letters.
But your mother gets letters.
Don't have a mother.
No wonder you were crying.
I wasn't crying about mothers.
I was crying because I can't get the shadow to stick.
And I wasn't crying!
I could sew it on for you.
This may hurt a little.
Might I borrow your knife?
Thank you.
Oh, the cleverness of me!
Of course, I did nothing.
Aw, you did a little.
A little?
Good night.
Wendy?
One girl is worth more than 20 boys.
You really think so?
I live with boys... the Lost Boys.
They are well named.
Who are they?
Children who fall out of their prams when the nurse is not looking.
If they are not claimed in seven days, they are sent to the Neverland.
Are there girls too?
Girls are much too clever to fall out of their prams.
Peter, it is perfectly lovely the way you talk about girls.
I should like to give you... a... kiss.
Don't you know what a kiss is?
I shall know when you give me one.
I suppose I'm to give you one now.
If you like.
Thank you.
How old are you, Peter?
Quite young.
Don't you know?
I ran away.
One night, I heard my mother and father talking of what I was to be when I became a man.
So I ran away to Kensington Gardens and I met Tink.
Tink?
Tinker Bell.
She's my fairy.
But there's no such thing as... Don't say that.
Every time somebody says that, a fairy somewhere falls down dead.
And I shall never find her if she's dead.
You don't mean to tell me there's a fairy in this room.
We come to listen to the stories.
I like the one about the prince who couldn't find the lady who wore glass slippers.
Cinderella.
Peter, he found her and they...and they... lived happily ever after.
I knew it.
Peter.
I should like to give you... a... thimble.
What's that?
- Tink!
Tink.!
Tink, no.!
She's not very polite.
She says if you try to give me a thimble again, she'll kill you.
Oh.
And I had supposed fairies to be charming.
Peter, don't go.
I have to tell the others about Cinderella.
But I know lots of stories, stories I could tell the boys.
Come with me.
L...
I cannot fly.
I'll teach you.
I'll teach you to ride the wind's back.
And away we go.
Could John and Michael come too?
Michael!
Michael!
- John!
John!
I didn't do it.
There is a boy here who is to teach us to fly.
You offend reason, sir.
Mm-hmm.
I should like to offend it with you.
You just think happy thoughts, and they lift you into the air.
It's easy.
I've got it!
I've got it!
Swords, daggers, Napoleon!
Stand back.
Yahoo!
John!
Wendy.!
Wendy.!
Watch me.!
Puddings, mud pies, ice cream, never to take a bath again!
Michael.!
Whoa!
Come away.
Come away to Neverland.
Oh.
What about Mother?
Father?
Nana?
There are mermaids.
Mermaids?
Indians!
Indians?
Pirates!
Pirates?
Whoa-ho!
John, wait for me.!
May I introduce my wife... Mary?
Mary.
Mary.
Delighted.
Thank you, Sir Edward.
Forget them, Wendy.
Forget them all.
Come with me where you'll never, never have to worry about grown-up things again.
What is it?
What's wrong?
Never is an awfully long time.
It would be delightful to report that they reached the nursery in time.
But then there would be no story.
But you're covered in dog hair, my darling.
Hello, old chap.
Good evening.
Thank you.
Whoa-ho!
Higher!
Who are you?
I'm John.
John.
Take hold of this.
Ta-da!
Both hands.
Pass it on.
Michael, take hold of my ankle.
Wendy, take hold of my ankle!
And whatever happens, don't... let... go!
Neverland.
Lying, thieving a life of sin Apirating we go We're sure to meet below Fire the cannons Pour the rum Deal the cards For night has come A pirating we go Devil bird!
Cap'n?
Cap'n?
As I was sitting wide-eyed on my watch, I noticed it was wintertime on the water and springtime on the shore.
I says to meself, "That's early for spring to be astir.
Spring's not due till 3:00 p.m." Check the time yourself, Cap'n, and then tell...
I was dreaming, Smee, of Pan.
Pan, Cap'n?
And in my dream, I was a magnanimous fellow... full of forgiveness.
I thanked Pan... for cutting off my hand... and for giving me this fine hook... for disemboweling and ripping throats... and other such homely uses... as combing my hair.
So, Pan did you a favor then, Cap'n?
A favor?
He threw my hand to a crocodile.
The beast liked it so much, it's followed me ever since, licking its lips for the rest of me.
You call that a favor?
No.
No.
No.
No.
Thank you.
Thank Lucifer the beast swallowed a clock.
If it wasn't for the ticking, it'd have had me by now.
Why did you wake me, Smee?
Like I said, Cap'n, the ice is melting.
The sun is out.
And the flowers are all in bloom.
He's back.
Forty gunner.
She must do 12 knots under full sail.
Noodler, with his hands on backwards.!
BillJukes!
Every inch of him tattooed.
Hook.!
Let's take a closer look.
Yahoo!
Peter!
Watch this.
Whoa-ho-ho!
Whoa!
My hat!
Ugly Smee!
Ugly, fat Smee!
Solar eclipse.
Dark in here.
Let me out.
Let me out.!
Can't see.
Dark in here.
Candle.
I need candle.
Help.!
Help.!
Fetch Long Tom.
Fire!
Help!
Help!
Tink, find Wendy.
Leave the rest to me.
Wendy.
Oh, Captain Hook!
Pan!
Stay with him!
You can't catch me.
Over here.!
Fire!
Timber!
Whoa!
Michael, are you shot?
I haven't checked yet!
But there's something worser!
Oh, what could be worse?
My thoughts aren't very happy!
Happy thoughts!
Happy thoughts.
What would Mom and Dad do?
Napoleon!
Damnation.!
Reload the cannon!
Quickly!
Reload the cannon?
Any other contributions?
Search the jungle!
Bring me those children!
What is it?
It's a large white bird.
Quite ugly too.
No!
Give me it!
When Peter's away, I'm in charge!
I get to look through the telescope.
It's coming closer.
My God, I've gone blind!
I'm blind.
I've gone blind.
I'm blind.
Hello, Tink.
Where's Peter?
Hello, Tink.
She's blinded me!
Hello, Tink.
Hello, Tink.
Any more news of Cinderella?
Now, Tinker Bell was not all bad.
Sometimes she was all good.
But fairies are so small they only have room for one feeling at a time.
Tink says the bird's called a..."Wendy."
And Peter wants us to... Oh, Peter!
Oh!
Shoot it down.
Well, we have our orders.
Shoot the Wendy bird.
Aye, aye!
Ready?
Aim!
Fire!
Bye-bye!
Three, two, one.!
I got it.
I got it!
That is no bird.
It is a lady.
And Tootles... Tootles has killed her.
Ha!
I'm back!
Great news.
I know what happened to Cinderella.
She defeated the pirates.
There was stabbing, slicing, torturing, bleeding... and they lived happily ever after.
Well, that's a relief, I must say.
Greater news.!
I have brought you she that told of Cinderella.
She is to tell us stories!
She is... Dead.
Tragic.
Awful.
Good shot, though.
Whose arrow?
Mine, Peter.
Strike, Peter.
Strike true.
The Wendy lives!
It's my kiss.
My kiss saved her.
I remember kisses.
Let me see it.
Aye, that is a kiss.
A powerful thing.
Let us carry her down to the house.
Hands.
They're a bit dirty.
She must stay here and die.
No!
Oh, how could I have thought that?
Stupid.
Sorry.
We shall build a house around her.
With a chimney!
And a door knocker!
And windows!
Tink did it.
Tinker Bell?
Oh, Tinker Bell?
Was it you, Tink?
Hallelujah.
Hallelujah.
Then I am your friend no more.
First impressions are very, very important.
Here she is.
Look loveable.
Wendy lady, for you we built this house with a door knocker.
And a chimney.
One, two, three.
Please be our mother.
Oh.
Well, it is frightfully fascinating.
But, you see, I've had no real experience.
Do you tell stories?
Yes.
Then you're perfect.
Very well.
I will do my best.
Hooray!
Sorry about the blindfold.
We must be cautious.
There are some nasty characters about.
If Hook discovers our hideout, he'll gut us.
How dreadful!
Oh, we live for it!
But l... Time to meet Father, Mother.
So looking forward to being your son.
Welcome, Mother.
Discipline.
That's what fathers believe in.
You must spank the children immediately before they try to kill you again.
In fact, we should kill them.
Peter!
Father!
I agree that they are perfectly horrid, but kill them and they shall think themselves important.
So important.
And unique.
I suggest something... far more dreadful.
Medicine.
It's the most beastly, disgusting stuff.
The sticky, sweet kind.
Kill us, please!
Kill us, please!
Littlest first.
Michael?
Michael.
John.
My brothers!
Who?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
It's louder from inside this rock.
How very peculiar.
Happy thoughts.!
Swords, daggers, Napoleon.!
How humiliating.
John, there's something worser.
Princess Tiger Lily.
We search as ever for Peter Pan... and his secret hideout.
Luckily, two boys of his acquaintance... were seen falling into this part of thejungle.
Have you seen them?
She says, "Sorry, but, no."
My Hook thinks you have, Princess.
I say, unhand that savage, you... you...you savage.!
Now, mermaids are not as they are in storybooks.
They are dark creatures... in touch with all things mysterious.
If Hook had captured Wendy's brothers, the mermaids would know.
Oh, how sweet.
Are mermaids not sweet?
They'll sweetly drown you if you get too close.
Hook has your brothers at the Black Castle.
Like all surprise attacks, it must be conducted... improperly.
Put the children on the rock.
Sorry, Your Highness.
Any last words?
Beg for your lives.
Sirs!
My brother and I are English gentlemen.
English gentlemen do not beg.
Please!
Please!
Please!
Please don't kill us!
Please don't kill me, either.
I've never done anything... Aah!
It's cold!
It's cold!
Help.!
Come on.
Fly to the rescue, and then I'll shoot you right through your noble intentions.
I brought these.
Can you use it?
Promise me one thing.
Leave Hook to me.
I promise.
Wait here for my signal.
Wait here?
Peter.!
Thus Wendy first laid eyes on the dark figure who haunted her stories.
She saw the piercing eyes and was not afraid, but entranced.
Mr. Smee?
That you, Cap'n?
Brimstone and gall, man.
What do you think you're doing?
Well, we've put the children on the rope, Cap'n, like you said.
Set 'em free.!
Set 'em free?
Well, what about your trap?
Set them free, or I'll plunge my hook in you.
I don't know what he wants with 'em.
I'm just a blithering idiot, aren't I?
Chain 'em up.
Let 'em go.
And take your cat with ya.
Mr. Smee?
Aye, Cap'n?
Any sign of him?
No, Cap'n.
Where are the children?
It's all right, Cap'n.
We let 'em go.
You what?
We let 'em go.
You... let... them... go.
Who are you, stranger?
I am James Hook, captain of the Jolly Roger.
If you are Hook, then who am I?
You are a codfish.
Tell me, Hook, have you another name?
Aye.
Vegetable?
No.
Mineral?
No.
Animal?
Yes.
Man?
No!
Boy?
Yes!
Ordinary boy?
No!
Wonderful boy?
Yes.!
Do you give up?
Yes!
I am... History.
Peter, look out!
There he is!
It is your requiem mass, boy.
Ready to lose the other one?
Not this time.
Ooh-ooh, girlie.
Who be you to call me girlie?
Ow.
Open the gate.!
Teddy.!
Ew.
Oh.
If I were you, I'd give up.
If you were me, I'd be ugly.
No!
Ready?
Fire!
Get the boat!
Turn the boat around.
Turn it around!
And now, Peter Pan, you shall die.
To die will be an awfully big adventure.
Oh, no.
You.
Smee!
Smee.!
It's all a bit tragic, really, isn't it?
The warrior is wounded.
She is calling forth the spirit of the eagle to heal the warrior.
It's so impressive.
The warrior is healed.
Peter?
Shh.
Peter?
Evil day.
He has found himself a... Wendy?
And Hook is all alone.
Me too.
You too?
Banished?
Tsk, tsk.
The dog.
I think you and I... should talk.
Wendy?
It's only make-believe, isn't it?
That you and I are... Oh.
Yes.
Wendy?
You see, it would make me seem so old to be a real father.
Peter, what are your real feelings?
Feelings?
What do you feel?
Happiness?
Sadness?
Jealousy?
Jealousy?
Tink!
Anger?
Anger.
Hook.
Love?
Love?
Love.
I have never heard of it.
I think you have, Peter.
I daresay you've felt it yourself... for something or... someone.
Never.
Even the sound of it offends me.
Peter.
Why do you spoil everything?
We have fun, don't we?
I taught you to fight and to fly.
What more could there be?
There is so much more.
What?
What else is there?
I don't know.
I think it becomes clearer when you grow up.
Well, I will not grow up!
You cannot make me!
I will banish you like Tinker Bell!
I will not be banished!
Then go home.
Go home and grow up.
And take your feelings with you!
Peter!
Peter, come back!
Peter!
Peter did not want Wendy to leave.
Once again, he visited Wendy's home... to see if Mr. And Mrs.
Darling had closed the window yet.
But, as before, he saw Mrs.
Darling in her chair... by the window, her eyes tired with searching the heavens.
Wendy.
Wendy.
Wendy.
We can't both have her, lady.
John!
Michael!
Wendy!
The window's closed.
George!
George, help me!
What is it?
Have they returned?
The window is closed.
It must always be open for them.
Always.
Always.
They've not returned.
Avast belay the English brig We took and quickly sank And for a warning to the crew We made them walk the plank Yo ho, yo ho the frisky plank He walks along it so Welcome.
Shh, shh.
Till it goes down and you's go down To tooral looral loo Wrote it himself.
Wendy, darling.
Muscat, miss?
I'm a little girl.
Rum, then?
No, thank you.
I'm told you ran away from home.
L...
I had never thought of it that way.
I suppose I did.
How wonderful.
My parents wanted me to grow up.
Growing up is such a barbarous business, full of inconvenience and pimples.
Things were simpler when I was younger.
And then the mess starts, the feelings come.
Pan is so lucky to be untroubled by them.
Oh, no.
He cannot love.
It's part of the riddle ofhis being.
Cigar?
Oh, there, there.
Shh, shh, shh.
Tsk, tsk, tsk.
It doesn't have to be this way.
Didst thou ever want to be a pirate, my hearty?
I once thought of calling myself... Mm?
Red-Handed Jill.
Oh, what a marvelous name!
That's what we'll call you if you join us.
But what would my duties be?
I could not be expected to pillage.
Do you, um, by any chance, tell stories?
And they all lived happily... ever... after.
Bravo!
Bravissimo.!
Might I have time to consider your generous offer?
Absolutely.
Of course, you must.
My fellows will return you whence they found you.
None of my crew will follow you.
I swear it.
My new obsession is you, not dear Peter Pan or his whereabouts.
What would Mother think of my becoming a pirate?
Until we meet again.
What would Mother think if she became a pirate?
But the more Wendy thought ofher mother, the less she could remember.
John.
I wasn't doing anything!
John!
Yes?
What is your father's name?
My father's name?
Peter.
Father!
Yea, Peter!
Michael, who is your mother?
Well, he got the easy one.
You are my mother, Wendy.
And isn't she just first-class?
There's a new pirate aboard the Jolly Roger.
The mermaids say she is called Red-Handed Jill.
Another adventure, boys.
Come on!
Red-Handed Jill?
She sounds quite fearsome!
Fearsome?
She's just a storyteller.
Just a storyteller?
Red-Handed Jill may be a brave swordsman.
A girl like her?
Brave or not, I shall run her through!
Then ready yourself, Peter Pan, for I am Red-Handed Jill.
Mother!
Wendy?
'Tis true, John.
Your sister has been invited to piracy.
But, Mother, Hook is a fiend.
And a bounder.
On the contrary, I find Captain Hook to be a man of feeling.
Mother and Father are fighting again.
Sir, you are both ungallant and deficient.
How am I deficient?
You're just a boy.
Are you really to be a pirate, Mother?
No.
We are going home.
Home?
Leave Neverland?
We must.
We have forgotten our parents.
We must leave at once before we... in turn are forgotten.
I've forgotten... my parents.
We must leave.
If you wish it.
"If you wish it"?
If you wish it!
Kill!
Kill!
Kill!
Kill!
Kill!
Kill!
Kill!
Don't fret, my dear.
With Pan dead, we'll both be free.
I have arranged a fairy guide to lead you back.
Peter, we've been talking.
What if you came back with us?
Can we go, Peter?
Please, Peter, can we go?
If you wish it.
Get your things.
You too, Peter.
Would they send me to school?
Yes.
Then... to an office?
I suppose so.
Soon I should be a man.
You can't catch me and make me a man.
Peter.
I want always to be a boy and have fun.
You say so, but I think it is your biggest pretend.
Oh!
Ooh.
Ooh-la-la!
Bye-bye!
There's no such thing as fairies.
Don't forget your medicine.
- Surprise.
A new era begins.
Take them away.
No medicine.
I don't wanna take medicine.
No.
Lest he should be taken alive, Hook always carried upon his person a dreadful poison... distilled when he was weeping from the red ofhis eye.
No.
A mixture of malice, jealousy and disappointment, it was instantly fatal and without antidote.
I was not asleep!
Wendy?
Wendy?
Are you there?
Tink.
You drank my medicine.
Tinker Bell?
Tink?
Why is your light going out?
Tink, why are you so cold?
Stay warm, Tink.
Stay warm.
Please come back.
Please, Tink, don't leave me.
Forgive me, Tink.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry, Tink.
Please forgive me.
Tink!
There's still room for a storyteller.
I'd rather die.
Shame.
Cap'n, Cap'n.
Look at the sky.
And look at the water.
Pan must be dead.
No!
No!
Impossible!
Ship's company, hats off!
A moment's silence for our fallen enemy, Peter Pan.
We sail at dawn!
I do believe in fairies.
I do.

I do.!
I do.!
I do believe in fairies.!
I do.!
I do.!
I do believe in fairies.!
I do.!
I do.!
He's alive!
Oh, help.
It's Hook or me this time.
Why is he?
What is he?
I'll have one last story before you die.
The story of Peter Pan.
Once upon a time... Once upon a time... Brutes, Red-Handed Jill is gonna tell us a story.
There was a boy named Peter Pan... who decided not to grow up.
Skip the prologue.
So he flew away to the Neverland where the pirates are.
Was one of them pirates called Noodler?
Yes.
Captain, did you hear?
I am in a story.
What fun he must have had.
Yes.
But he was rather lonely.
Lonely?
He needed a Wendy.
I need a Wendy.
Very exciting.
Two dead already.
Why a Wendy?
He liked my stories.
What stories?
Cinderella.
Snow White.
Sleeping Beauty.
Love stories?
Adventures in which good triumphs over evil.
- They all end in a kiss.
A kiss.
He does feel.
He feels about you.
She told him stories.
He taught her to fly.
How?
You just think happy thoughts.
They lift you into the air.
Alas, I have no happy thoughts.
That brings you down.
How else?
No!
Leave her alone.!
It's fairy dust.
You need fairy dust!
Michael.!
What of Pan?
Will unhappy thoughts bring him down?
He has no unhappy thoughts.
Aw.
How if his Wendy walks the plank!
Plank.!
Plank.!
Plank.!
Plank.!
Plank.!
Plank.!
Plank.!
Plank.!
Plank!
Plank!
Plank!
Plank!
Plank!
Plank!
Plank!
Plank!
Plank!
Plank!
Plank!
Plank!
Plank, plank, plank!
You know, I really am terribly sorry about this.
The irony.
It comes for Hook... and gets a story.
No!
- No!
Did you hear her hit the water?
Because I didn't.
The beast has swallowed her whole.
Hmm.
Starboard side!
It looks for more, Captain.
Then let's give it more.
To the plank!
Silence, puling spawn!
I'll show you the road to dusty death.
Huh?
Into the rigging with you!
Hunt it down!
Move, you scabs!
What was that?
It's here, Captain.!
Devil.!
Demon.!
Accursed beast.!
Your time is up.!
Hello.
So, Peter Pan.
This is all your doing.
Aye, James Hook.
It's all my doing.
Proud and insolent youth, prepare to meet thy doom.
Have at thee!
Leave him.!
He's mine.
Now!
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh!
Here you are.
Here.
I never wanted to be a pirate anyway.
I'm gonna spend the rest of my life doing good works.
I got him!
Villain!
Ne'er-do-well!
Libertine.!
It's Hook!
He flies!
And he likes it!
You want to fly?
Let's fly.
Not bad... for an old man.
I know what you are!
I am the best there ever was!
You're a tragedy.
Me?
Tragic?
She was leaving you, Pan.
Your Wendy was leaving you.
Why should she stay?
What have you to offer?
You are incomplete.
She'd rather grow up than stay with you.
Let us now take a peep into the future.
What's this I see?
'Tis the fair Wendy.
She's in her nursery.
The window's shut.
I'll open it!
I'm afraid the window's barred.
I'll call out her name.
She can't hear you.
No!
She can't see you.
Wendy!
She's forgotten all about you.
Stop!
Please!
Stop it!
And what is this I see?
There is another in your place.
He is called... husband.
No.!
Peter.!
You die alone... and unloved.
Unloved.
Just like me.
No!
No!
Silence, all, for Wendy's farewell.
Peter.
I'm sorry.
I must grow up.
But... this is yours.
'Tis just a thimble.
How like a girl!
By all means, my beauty.
Give Peter Pan your precious thimble.
This belongs to you... and always will.
Ohh.
That was no thimble.
That was her hidden kiss.
Brace yourselves, lads.
'Tis a powerful thing.
Pan, you're pink!
Split my infinitives!
No!
I have won!
Whoo-hoo!
You... are old.
But I won!
Old.
And alone!
Alone.
No!
I won!
I won!
- Done for.
Happy thoughts.
Happy thoughts.
Ripping!
Killing!
Killing!
Choking!
Lawyers!
Dentists!
Old!

Uh, children's blood.
Puppies' blood.

Alone.
Done for!
Done for.
Brimstone and gall!
Silence, you dogs!
Or I'll cast anchor in you.
We won!
We won!
Ready to cast off?
Aye.
Aye, Captain.
Oh, the cleverness of you.
Mother.
Nana.
Let us break it to her gently.
Oh, Nana.
I dreamt my little ones had come back.
I dreamed they were asleep... in their beds.
But they will never come back.
They did not understand how she could not see them.
But, you see, she saw them in their beds so often in her dreams... that she thought this was just the dream hanging around her still.
Hello, Mother.
It really is us.
Michael.
John.
Wendy.
We're back.
George, come quickly!
I'm coming.!
What is it?
We're back, Father.
Did you miss us?
You're back.
Good.
Excellent.
Well done.
Oh, my angel.
Of course I missed you.
All right, boys, follow me.
Get your hands off that wallpaper.
Now, come on in.
The silliest thing.
These young gentlemen say that... You're back.
Ohhh.
Mother, Father, I would like to introduce the Lost Boys.
Hello.
Hats.
May I keep them?
Well, l-l...
I mean, the expense.
Think of the neighbors.
Dash the neighbors!
And dash the expense!
Welcome to the family, boys.
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
Will this help the expense, Father?
Anyone for a pony ride?
I'm Tootles.
Tootles, darling.
I'm Curly.
Curly, darling.
And what's your name?
Nibs.
I plan the battles.
Would you like a mother, Nibs?
Yes.
Oh!
What is the matter, child?
I couldn't find the house.
And now everyone has a mother, except me.
Is your name Slightly?
Yes.
Then I am your mother.
How do you know?
I feel it in my bones.
Mother!
George!
Mary!
I have a son!
There could not have been a lovelier sight, but there was none to see it... except a strange boy who was staring in at the window.
Peter Pan had countless joys... that other children can never know, but he was looking at the onejoy... from which he must be forever barred.
To live would be an awfully big adventure.
Peter!
You won't forget me, will you?
Me?
Forget?
Will you come back?
To hear stories... about me.
But I was not to see Peter Pan again.
Now I tell his story to my children, and they will tell it to their children... and so it will go on.
For all children grow up... except one.
